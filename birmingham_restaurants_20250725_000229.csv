I recently stayed at Malmaison Birmingham for two nights and had a truly wonderful experience. From the moment I arrived, the staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and professional they really set the tone for a great stay.

The room was spotless, stylish, and very comfortable. Everything felt fresh and well-maintained, making it easy to relax. I was also impressed with the breakfast a fantastic spread with delicious options that really exceeded expectations.

The location couldn’t be better right in the heart of Birmingham, making it super convenient to get around and explore the city. Everything was easy to find and navigate.

The only small suggestion I’d make is that I would have appreciated being told about the spa services at check-in. I only found out about them through the in room leaflet, and it would’ve been great to know earlier to plan ahead.

Overall, an amazing stay and I’d happily return. Highly recommended!",2025-05-18 23:21:41,en

I have seen a bias on even taking orders based on the people that are at the table. Breakfast the first morning had to be returned as it had clearly been left under heat lamp for too long and made the eggs rubbery. However they did make something fresh. It may be a particular shift/members of staff but there is a definite lack of care and ambivalence to the guests at breakfast both days I was staying here.
The room was great, excellent sanctuary from whatever has dragged you to Birmingham. I am staying during a heatwave and the aircon in the room was a life saver. Spacious big bed and room, fridge, tea and coffee facilities. No bottled water in room, which is fine for me, but I know sometimes is nice to have.

The room was absolutely beautiful for standard. Wasn't that bothered about the view since the curtains would be closed anyway!
Food in the attached restaurant was top quality and definitely value for money. For £30, it includes unlimited breakfast and a evening meal deal comprising of either starter and main OR main and dessert. I chose starter (beef burnt ends) and main (8oz rump with chips) and includes a drink. WOW!

Rooms were basic and mostly clean however, I did notice some light stains which looked like makeup and some hairs under the duvet, hence the 4 stars. Also, the bed wasn’t a double, it was two singles beds merged but I slept fine.

Just wished they had extra towels in the rooms. Once I had unpacked, I noticed an issue with our AC, spoke to reception, someone came to have a look and it was broken, and we got moved immediately - service staff were super helpful, I didn’t get their names but bless them, they apologised a few times. So thank you!

Location was great and a 15min walk into town/ Bull Ring. Plenty of shops for everyone. Breakfast is pretty average but the orange juice and pastries were nice! They did have boiled eggs, beans, cereal and etc. Lovely jubbly :)

Plenty of seating near the bar area if you have any work to do in the evening, same spot in the AM is where breaky is served.

I specifically booked this hotel because it advertised having air conditioning, and with the recent heat, I wanted a comfortable stay. Unfortunately, the air conditioner in my room didn’t work at all. What made things worse is that the hotel did not inform me about this at check-in.

When I raised the issue, the receptionist told me they were fully booked and couldn’t move me to another room. She offered me breakfast or a drink instead – which I declined – but this felt like a poor attempt to make up for such a serious comfort issue, especially in peak summer heat.

What’s most frustrating is that I later checked Google reviews and saw someone else had the exact same issue a week before my stay. Clearly, this is an ongoing problem, and they continue to check guests into rooms knowing the air conditioning doesn’t work. This is highly unprofessional and misleading. If the AC is broken, these rooms should not be in use.

I expected more from a large hotel chain. Sadly, I wouldn’t recommend this place – at least not until they fix their air conditioning and improve how they handle guest concerns.",2025-07-13 11:23:59,en

Large room with a super king bed. Great shower.
The only downsides were the pillows weren't the most comfortable but were ok.
Perfect location (opposite New St station) and close to many bars and restaurants etc. However, just outside of the hotel was really run down and derelict.

The air con didn't work (wouldn't even turn on). When I informed reception, they said they'd try and fix it during the day, and that if they couldn't, then they'd move me to a different room. They didn't fix it and told me I couldn't move rooms as most of the rooms didn't have air conditioning working either.

Very convenient location: shops, public transport links, and other conveniences within walking distance and was seemingly safe in terms of security.
Great value for money.
Although staff were very friendly, helpful and assisting when they were there, there were many occasions when there was absolutely nobody at the front desk, so waiting for someone to be able to assist you at all was often a matter of waiting 10 minutes (approx), so I would suggest having 2 people at the front desk for each shift always, so even if 1 is gone away, the other will still be there. I would also suggest having in-room telephones.
The only other slightly disappointing factor was if we are staying more than 1 night, housekeeping is not done in the room unless requested before 12pm, which I didn’t realise until after that, and I wished the cups and mugs were changed and stock on water bottles and chocolate were replenished.

The pizza, unfortunately, was a bit underwhelming. It was light on toppings, which made it lack flavor. We also tried the seafood grill main, which really could’ve used some salt, garlic, and chili to bring it to life.

There are two levels to the restaurant and we were sat at a table tucked away which was great. Lots of mirrors with a ceiling full of artificial roses. It’s over the top but suits the venue and adds to the experience.

Great wine. Lots of Italian choices. We had a couple bottles of the primitivo after a round of negronis (pleased an Italian place can make these well too)

My starter was overdone under the grill. I’ve had the baked aubergine parmagiano many times and this unfortunately wasn’t their best. Monkfish tagliatelle and the shared dessert more than made up for it.

The dessert was three mini portions per person and a limoncello shot for £9 each. Great value.

My frutti de mare was good, loads of seafood, probably the pasta is overcooked a bit to my taste. But I like the subtle spicy that bring the dish better.

The selection on tap is mostly the same as you’d expect, but The Old Joint Stock Pub stands out for a few reasons: The bar staff were really friendly and welcoming, which is always a pleasant surprise for Londoners visiting other cities in the UK—and definitely appreciated. The food was also great.. Classic pub food done well and with an interesting twist - we had the macaroni bites, chicken and roast potatoes with marmite, plus a cub sandwich, washed down with Frontier and Guinness. The pies looked great too. Despite being a city centre pub, it had a relaxed vibe with excellent service bringing the food to the table, cutlery, etc. It’s clear they take service seriously. Another unique aspect of the pub is the theatre upstairs, which adds to the uniqueness. Even though it’s owned by a brewery chain, it has its own distinctive style. The decor is well thought out, with a lovely connection to its history, and there are no TVs or other elements that can ruin classic pub old interiors.The other customers were a mix of colleagues after work, dates, and small groups of people— all respectful.

We were seated promptly at our table time and were brought a complimentary nibble with our popadoms, whilst we eagerly awaited our starter.  We chose a sharing platter starter of chicken, lamb, salmon and king prawn which was absolutely devine!  For our mains my husband chose a chicken dish in traditional curry style and I chose beef cheek on a dahl base.  This was accompanied by pilau rice, plain naan and peshwari naan.  Both dishes were excellent, although I was expecting the beef to have more Indian spicing - still delicious!  The naans were lovely and fluffy and very fresh.  Portions were very generous and we couldn't quite finish our dishes.  We both then enjoyed chocolate fondant desserts with pistachio ice-cream.

The food and service are very good here, I've never been overly indulgent when it comes to Italian cuisine but when eating here me and my cousin always overorder but finish the lot, each time we come our bill is always over £140 as we do like to try a bit of everything.
No regrets BTW.

The pasta dishes are perfectly flavoured and if you have any meat dishes, they are top-notch with very little to critique from a negative POV.

The restaurant's decor is lovely, you easily feel at home here with it being decorated sympathetically.

The only negative I had was this visit we were seated upstairs, it was lovely up there but very quiet. When we got seated it was only us on the whole floor and (at a guess) with seating for probably at least 60 diners.
It did have a few tables through the night but was very quiet up there which is not what we're used to.
But hey, I'm seriously picking minor details up here.

Overall a solid night out at this place with a cracking environment, staff and most importantly food 👌

There's an iron and ironing board, hairdryer l, a big fan (it was a warm day) and teas, coffee, hot chocolate and bottled water (with biscuits) all in the price. Beautifully comfy double bed too and a decent sized wall mounted tv.

This place is absolutely spotless too.

The staff are all super nice and the service is kind and efficient.

Honestly, I'm amazed at how brilliant it all is fornthe almost free price. I cant praise it highly enough - we love it so much we've booked another night (41 quid).

Ooh, the bar area too - again, flawless. Great service, nice staff, the bar is perfect, it just screams ""well managed"". The Freedom breakfast is the best £3.99 you're ever going to spend.

As someone who often finds veggie options to be a bit of an afterthought at Chinese restaurants, Chung Ying was a refreshing exception.

Their vegetarian dim sum menu is genuinely thoughtful, not just the usual spring rolls and tofu. The standout for me was the vegetable cheung fun—silky rice noodle rolls filled with perfectly seasoned mushrooms and greens, drizzled with a sweet soy sauce that tied everything together beautifully. The vegetarian siu mai and spinach dumplings were also excellent: delicate, flavorful, and clearly made with care.

What I appreciated most was that nothing felt like a compromise. Every dish was well-balanced and satisfying, with textures and flavors that made each bite interesting. Even the dipping sauces were spot on, complementing the dishes rather than overpowering them.

So, it was lovely to head back to Ching Ying Garden and attempt to eat our bodyweight in Dim Sum.

I love that you order what you want on a sheet of paper, then sit back and wait for the dishes to arrive in whatever order the kitchen make them.

The Dim Sum was the star of the show, loads of little dumplings still sat in their steaming baskets, alongside the steamed buns. Delicious.

I was a bit disappointed in the triple Roast Meats, however, I've definitely had both better and bigger portions in Chinatown. But still perfectly serviceable.

The staff, wearing smiles as their uniform, made me feel like a cherished guest. From the very moment I walked in, I knew this was going to be a delightful experience.

Let me tell you about the Almond Croissant – a heavenly creation with a flaky crust that seemed to melt in my mouth. The almond cream filling was like a secret treasure, rich and velvety. This wasn't just a pastry; it was a work of art, carefully crafted to perfection.

But the surprises didn't stop there. The Banana Caramel Muffin was a symphony of flavors – sweet banana dancing with luscious caramel. And that topping? It wasn't just a topping; it was like a delicious crown, adding a crunch that was incredibly satisfying. Believe me, this treat is a journey you won't want to miss.

Then, there was the Blueberry Muffin – a burst of tangy and sweet berries in every bite. The sugar-crusted top was like a sweet secret waiting to be discovered with every mouthful. I couldn't help but close my eyes and savor the blissful moment.

The pain au Chocolat was a rendezvous with sophistication. With each bite, it was like I was transported to a charming French café. The fusion of flavors was like a dance of elegance and comfort in my mouth.

And let's not forget the Chocolate Twist – it was like a playful game of hide and seek with chocolate surprises. Every twist revealed a burst of cocoa goodness, and it was perfect for anyone with a love affair with chocolate.

I can't remember what I got charged but over all disappointed, I base my review on value for money and experience and I felt let down. Pic of slop attached with this review.

Given the pricing, we expected a higher standard, both in terms of food and service. Unfortunately, the customer service fell short.

The pick of the dishes, for me, was the soya tikka biriyani. If I was to describe it better, it is a Nan topped rice and (Meat,vegetables,vegan meat) pie delivered with a side of curry sauce.

Not the freshest sushi I’ve had, and the presentation was rather plain, but portions were generous and satisfying. With more refined plating, it could be even better.

Served in a fun, train shaped tray that immediately caught the kids’ attention! Includes fried chicken, prawn, rice ball, tamagoyaki, fruit, and a cup of apple juice. Well balanced and filling, the kids were delighted!

🍜 Mount Fuji Giant Prawn Ramen
Comes with two large fried prawns and dumplings. Even though the fried items were soaked in the soup, they stayed flavorful. The tonkotsu broth was rich and aromatic without being overly salty.

A nostalgic Japanese treat! Classic melon soda with a scoop of ice cream. Tastes great and perfect for photos.

A bit of a wait for starters and main. Starters were enjoyable, however after a chat with the owner/manger who was a pleasant and friendly gentleman I opted for an off menu steak option. In the mangers defense he did say it was a 'big' Ribeye cut and offered a decent discount, BUT I should have asked how big before saying medium rare. When it eventually arrived, it was more than a kilo, absolutely huge. This size of steak doesn't fair well rare and the fat was totally unedible, and parts of the meat almost raw were chewy and very difficult to cut with all the tendons. The accompanying diane sauce was nice, veg aldente, however the potatoes were a little dry and overcooked. My daughters seafood linguini was ok however, she found the sauce a little spicy and the scallops chewy. I took most of my Ribeye home and finished it off in the oven next day for dinner and it was lovely. The lesson for me on this dining experience is that bigger is most certainly not always better 😆 I would be open to revisting to try something else off the menu.",2025-01-18 15:13:15,en

Unfortunately, my recent experiences at the Birmingham New Street branch have left me quite disappointed due to the behavior of one of the employees, Afyia.

On multiple occasions, I’ve noticed that she rarely smiles or makes an effort to be welcoming. It often feels like customers are not valued when she’s around. Today was the tipping point. She came outside to collect chairs and tables, but instead of politely asking customers to move, she raised her voice and demanded, “Excuse me, we’re going to take the chairs inside now!” The tone was aggressive and commanding, which made me and others feel extremely uncomfortable.

What bothered me most was that there were plenty of other chairs available that could have been taken first, but she felt the need to target a few customers and rush them in such an impolite way. There was no reason for this kind of behavior. Basic courtesy goes a long way, and it’s disheartening to see this lack of professionalism, especially at a place like Starbucks where customer service should be a priority.

Great coffee is available everywhere these days, but customer service is what sets businesses apart. I hope Starbucks addresses this issue at the Birmingham New Street branch, as it’s not the experience I expect from a brand I’ve been loyal to for years.",2024-09-28 19:57:08,en

Of course, it depends on what you’re looking for, but we personally didn’t enjoy our visit.

The service felt very intense, almost like the staff were looking down on us. I get that they have a certain etiquette, but true professionalism means adapting to each customer’s mood and experience – not making them feel uncomfortable. The food itself wasn’t bad, but for a Michelin-rated place, it didn’t blow us away.

We went with a Groupon voucher gifted to us, and were surprised when the bill included a hefty service charge of the full price menu, instead of just charging on top of drinks. I understand that some fine-dining places automatically include service, and normally I’m happy to pay it – if the service matches. But what if it’s young students or guests who received it as a gift and weren’t expecting to be hit with an extra £40–£50? Definitely something worth considering.

What bothered me most was that while filming parts of the experience (which is common in fine dining these days), the waiter told me not to film him as he presented the food. I wasn’t filming him directly – just capturing the overall experience. If you’re working in a high-end, presentation-focused restaurant, you should expect that some guests will be recording. If that’s an issue, maybe a different work environment would suit better.

Overall, the food was decent but not unforgettable, and you can absolutely find better Michelin-level restaurants where the service is warm, respectful, and genuinely customer-focused. Sadly, this one didn’t live up to expectations.",2025-05-12 10:48:46,en

Little did I know that when we arrived if was infact Santorini.  Not a good start when some of the Hens had had bad experiences at Santorini.
Anyhow, we arrive after I had booked it over 3 months ago for the table not to be ready (felt like we were not booked).
Tables set for a group of originally 26 but was for 24.  We were crammed in so setting the tables up with activities for the night it was a challenge.all the seat covers were minging and very dirty.

Before the guests had arrived food had been placed on the tables all with  small plates.
Stupidly we thought that we would eat what was on the table, have a break and then onto the mains... how wrong was I... the food kept coming with nothing to serve the food out with, so we were all double dipping.
The food was lovely however we all sat down and 7.40 and food was all out by 8.30.  Most of the food was wasted which is awful in this day and age.  We were offered boxes to take away but how could we, the food had been double if not quadruple dipped and left out for hours.
Drinks service was a joke too we waited ages to be served and when they arrived most drinks were forgotten.
I had travelled from Cannock for this special night and had spent many hours preparing, but was totally let down.  The floor was slippy and two of the guests had slipped badly on the floor and when deserts came, there was no additional plates nor forks or spoons it was a case of hands only.
The tables were full of plates, glasses etc to the point we moved them onto the sides to be able to access the tops of the tables.
Finally, the night was over by 10pm and we were been headed to pay.  We'll what was supposed to be £25.00 each some of us were charged 27.50... the owner wanted us to pay for service so he could pay his staff. This is what he said to me on several occasions.

I feel this place falsely advertises and offer the world when you look at the website.  I was expecting a late night but after arriving for the 7.30pm booking we had all left at 10.30pm.  The DJ was supposed to start at 11pm but that was oviousley not right as all hen parties had left around the same time.  Downstairs had a few people in but apart from.that it was obvious that the night had ended.

I'm gutted as the experience was utterly shocking.  The food was lovely and I feel that the chefs are been let down as the food was really nice but due to the service been poor and rushed with no change of plates nor serving cutlery it was sad.
Finally the floor is slippery and two.of the guests fell and one has had to.go to A&E die.to the fall and once reporting the fall the owner dismissed it and said he didn't see her fall but he has cameras.  No accident book!!!  Also when the plates were smashed those on the dance floor were close to the action and one.of.our guests foot was cut by a plate when it was smashed

If you choose to go as a big group collect the cash before hand and pay in bulk otherwise people will be charged more and perhaps don't bother as its a let down.  Such a shame as they are normally amazing nights out.",2025-03-23 16:44:43,en

I was early so got to soak in the atmosphere of this charming pub and I wasn't disappointed.
I'd previously been here under the previous owners and wasn't that impressed, but then I noticed it had closed for a bit and has now reopened under new ownership.
I stopped for a pint when passing when it first reopened and knew I'd be back.
Ignore the old reviews as this place deserves to be judged on how it is now.
Good selection of drinks including 3 cask ales, food was really nice and reasonable prices and the staff were awesome.

Today, I ordered my customary “Chicken Tikka Rice”, but to my dismay, the chicken was not cooked. Instead of expressing remorse for the error, the staff responded with rudeness. Such behavior is highly disrespectful and deeply disheartening to a loyal student.
The incident transpired approximately 20:45, when the kitchen was nearing its closing hour. In an attempt to expedite the process, the staff compelled me to place an order promptly. I believe this hastened the cooking mistake. The experience was profoundly disappointing.",2025-01-24 21:37:51,en

The venue has a great vibe — intimate enough to feel connected to the performance, yet big enough to handle a solid crowd without feeling cramped. The sound quality was impressive; every instrument came through clearly, and the vocals were spot on, which really brought the energy of the night to life.

The layout of the venue is smart, with decent views of the stage from most areas, and the tiered levels in the main room make it easier to see even if you’re not right at the front. The lighting setup added to the atmosphere, especially during high-energy tracks, and the acoustics made the whole experience even more immersive.

Staff and security were professional, friendly, and handled everything smoothly — from ticket checks to helping people find their way around. Entry was well organized and the bar staff were quick, even at peak times, which is always appreciated at a packed show.

Facilities were clean and well maintained, and the cloakroom was handy for storing jackets and bags. If I had to nitpick, the drinks were a little on the expensive side — not outrageous, but enough to notice. Still, that’s not unusual for live venues and didn’t take away from the night.

Overall, the O2 Academy Birmingham is a top-tier venue for live music. It’s got everything you need for a great night out and consistently delivers a quality concert experience. I’ll definitely be back for more gigs.",2025-04-11 19:11:16,en

CASH FREE RESTAURANT.
Half term is time to find the bestie places to go with kids.

This week we chose Pizza Hut because said that kids eat for free when you spend £10, BUT IS ONE KID FOR EVERY TRANSACTION, If you have a family with more that one child you only will get one child free at least that you do separate purchases for the food.
We do not make a booking before coming to the place, we has been there before and wasn’t so busy, but is half term so the best option is make in advance.

The Manager very friendly find the way to gives us a table, after one of the staff said that were very busy.

You have to scan QR code to make you order and pay online.

If you buy the promo for the buffet time is brilliant, you will have fresh pizzas, actually you can see when come out from the oven, the variety is very good and the salads island is okay, but I’m not a salad person.

And have refill with drinks and ice cream is absolutely amazing, specially if you want give a reward to your kids after hard work at school, plus have kids that finish SATs, deserve every penny that you spend.

Buy have no space for ramp or lift.

Was full of people but is okay, when you have kids you can manage be in a noise atmosphere.

From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere seemed promising, with a cozy and inviting vibe. However, that initial warmth quickly faded when we were met with a lack of enthusiasm from the staff. The waitress seemed disinterested and almost seemed like she couldn't be bothered to take our order when we tried to use the QR code to order. It was frustrating because it felt like we had to put in so much effort just to get her attention.

We were hoping that the food would make up for the poor service, but that too was a letdown. We started with the calamari, which was incredibly plain. It lacked any real flavor or seasoning—just a basic, bland offering. It definitely needed more ""oomph"" to make it memorable.

As for the main course, the Slow Cooked Beef and Ragu was supposed to be rich and flavorful, but unfortunately, it missed the mark entirely. The beef didn’t have any of the deep, tender flavors you’d expect from a slow-cooked dish. In fact, I could barely taste the beef at all, which was a huge disappointment. The sauce was fine, but it couldn’t make up for the lack of flavor in the meat itself.

Additionally, the food took a long time to arrive, which only added to the frustration. It's hard to enjoy a meal when you're already feeling impatient due to the slow service. Overall, the experience didn't live up to the expectations set by the nice atmosphere when we first walked in. I really wanted to enjoy my meal, but between the inattentive service and underwhelming food, it was hard to walk away feeling satisfied.

It was my first time at a Zizzi restaurant but always heard that the food was good but it does not live up to an authentic taste of Italian food.

Staff needs to be more trained in terms of customer service. There was no point of the experience where they asked if everything was okay.

We asked to have the desserts served but it didnt come until another waitress attended to us. When the desserts came, they gave us the wrong dessert - instead of honeycomb cheesecake, they gave the lemon and blueberry cheesecake.

Another display of lack of training, especially due to the lack of staff.

Never coming back to this branch. Waste of time. Waste of money.

I had a wonderful waitress named Indiana who was friendly, helpful, and polite. Initally the service was going great, where I had recieved my starters drinks and my daughter's main dish all in a fashionable amlunt of time.

However, I began to see time pass me as my main meal had not arrived. Indiana had approached me and asked if I had received my main meal and I had explained that I had not. At this point my daughter needed the toilet so I had to take her to the bathroom. Whilst on my way to the bathroom and unknowing to the manager and other staff, I had seen the chef plating up my food and placing underneath the hot light which was ready to be brought to my table.

I was in the bathroom between 5-7 minutes max and when I had come out I had Indiana along with another male staff member approach me apologising for my food taking so long to come to me and that they had spoken to the manager to try and knock the food off my bill. I mean god bless them.for trying they were absolutely lovely.

It was said to me that they knock food off the bill quite frequently when customers receive their food in a later time frame than when originally ordered and the 2 members of staff who had kindly argued for me and plead my case for me were unhappy with the managers decision as the manager refused to take the food off my bill.

The manager approached me with this fake type of happy energy and pretended to be apologetic about the situation and said I was in the bathroom when my food was brought out and that there was nothing she could do about it, even though i had waited over 35 minutes for my food which is hmjust absolutely unacceptable. Nevertheless, I just brushed it off as I didn't want to cause scene or fuss about in that particular setting as I did not like the managers energy, nor the way she had handled the situation as I found her to be unbothered and disingenuous about my long wait to recieve my food.

The manager asked me if there was anything she could do for me and when I asked if she could do something for me, she did not personally helped me as she walked off and did not re-attend my table, but instead made one of the other staff members attend my table which due to the poor service at this point I just wanted my bill to leave as my daughter was becoming restless, furthermore, I was unhappy with the insufficient service.

What should have been a nice meal for me and my daughter turned about to be mediocre and it would not be a place I would recommend or advise my friends or family or strangers to attend as the manager's complacency and unbothered mannerisms are off-putting to make you want to spend your money in such an establishment.",2025-04-09 12:52:35,en

This is the first time I have used upper crust. I had a very dry half of a baguette with half of a small sausage It was disgusting. I had a falafel with some peppers in a whole baguette which was of average taste. I had the worst example of a cheese baguette I have ever received in my lifetime as you can see from the photograph the thinnest slices of cheese I have ever seen with a couple of slices of very thin tasteless tomatoes. I strongly advise nobody to shop here. I think they should change their name to Lower Crust. This would be more appropriate.,2025-04-28 14:01:32,en

The Cross Contamination in this place is ridiculous. Im not asking for your hands to be washed everytime but wear gloves at least. I shouldnt have to go into a shop, pay for a service and explain how my food should be made. It's dissapointing because its not the worst place to visit but every visit makes it more unbearable.

However, today, I left this place extremely disappointed. Here’s why:
1.	Atmosphere and Ambiance:
As soon as we entered, there was an overwhelming stuffy smell; the kitchen odors hit you right in the face. Everything looked very messy, disorganized, and worn out.
2.	Cleanliness:
There were dirty used forks and napkins on the floor, and the staff were stepping over them as they walked by. The tables were sticky with grease and sauce stains from previous customers and had not been cleaned properly.
3.	Taste:
Both my meal and my spouse’s meal were served cold. The salads inside had no oil, no salt, and no dressing. The fries were also cold. We were both honestly shocked.
4.	Restrooms:
I was very surprised to see that the male and female restrooms were right next to each other without any separation. This is a basic expectation considering the general clientele of a halal restaurant. In fact, even many British restaurants ensure this comfort with separate entrances for men and women. I was very surprised and disappointed. Moreover, the restrooms were extremely dirty.
5.	Music:
There was very loud pub-style music with heavy bass playing. It was extremely overwhelming. Of course, music could be adjusted easily, but their choice of music shows how disconnected they are from the spirit of this business.

I truly did not want to write a negative review, but I felt I had to, with much regret and disappointment. I sincerely hope this feedback is taken seriously and improvements are made because German Döner is a brand — and this branch does not reflect the brand’s reputation at all.

I absolutely love the theatrics of their cocktails – they really create a unique, hands-on drinking experience that makes it more than just a drink, it’s a whole vibe.

The food was stunning! We ordered a variety of dishes, all beautifully presented and super tasty.

A couple of things that let the night down slightly: we were seated in a more secluded area, which felt a bit disconnected from the lively atmosphere. Also, the downstairs bar – which looks amazing – wasn’t open, which was a big letdown. Service was a bit slow too; we had to flag down staff a few times.

Me and my partner had ordered 2 chicken tasca meals on Deliveroo. This is something we occasionally order and enjoy, and we called up the store to specially ask for no siraccha on them as I’m allergic and my partner doesn’t like spice. The woman on the phone didn’t seem to listen properly but I trusted it as I have never had an issue before this. The order arrives and I can already see the siraccha dripping out of both of my tascas. I called up the store to ask them to re send them out, and the same lady answered and told me ‘we will just do better next time’, yet I’ve just wasted £40 on my dinner that I now cannot eat. I got passed on to a manager who told me to get a refund through Deliveroo, and I expressed how this is a joke as I wanted my dinner and would then have to wait 3-5 days for the money to come back into my bank. Very disgusted with the customer service and the lack of care when we are going out of our way to specially ask for changes on the order, I really suggest this branch trains their staff better with how to deal with customers, as I used to work at the Sutton Coldfield branch and we would have all our front of house staff well trained with better manners.

A decent pint of Guinness and ok service let down by sub par food and general cleanliness of the places (see photos). Food was ok nothing great not really worth the price you pay.

With good food at a competitive price, semedos offers the option to dine in and enjoy a comfortable meal.
All the food we have had from the restaurant has been brilliantly flavored and well presented, I must recommend the lunch time menu for a bargain meal.
The service is basic as they have a smaller number of staff working, but no more should be expected especially at the good price they are offering. The restaurant is often unfortunately quite, this should not deter and instead should be described as a hidden gem.
Other than the lunch time menu I have not sampled any of the wider menu, however the deserts do look amazing, but the wider main menu can rise more to the expensive side.

Another visit this Thursday at 4pm, another inefficient service. While there were only 5 customers including myself at the time, I waited exactly 20 minutes for my Chicken Mushroom Stroganoff and Peri Peri Burger. I wouldn't say they were lack of staff, they were just used to a below par service speed.

My Peri Peri Burger was again very dry this time, really hard to finish it without a drink. My Chicken Mushroom Stroganoff was not cooked in an Italian way, you could see from the photo that pasta, chicken and sauce were definitely cooked separately. Not looked very nice, but the actual taste was okay. The pasta was in a proper state, neither raw nor mush. The sauce was creamy with a Peri Peri mix, it went well with the pasta. However the chicken had a totally different taste, didn't have a harmony with the rest of the dish. At least, it reached my expectation for a £12.05 pasta dish.

I'm gradually losing my love with Semedos, the food quality is maybe not that high. Semedos will still be one of my options in Jewellery Quarter, though the order has definitely changed.

Another visit this Thursday at 5pm, still an off-peak period with only a few customers but the service was inefficient this time. It took me around 27 minutes to get everything I ordered (1/4 Peri Peri Chicken with Fries, 3pc Lamb Chops and 3pc Baklava).

Disappointingly, the chicken I got this time was too dry. Bigger portion of dry chicken just imagine, pack of protein! Nutritious but not delicious. The Lamb Chops and Baklava were both fine. That’s it, nothing more nothing less.

Some comments are saying that they waited more than an hour to get their dishes. If you order something big in a busy period, one hour is definitely possible and nothing is exaggerated.

Found this restaurant online and it had some decent reviews. First visit this Friday at 5pm, definitely an off-peak period. Only 1 staff there, but the service was friendly and efficient.

There was a huge menu with very competitive prices in Jewellery Quarter. The impression climaxed when I saw the 2 plates. Well, they looked so good with such prices. Maybe the expectation was too high, the actual tastes could not match in the end.

The best item for me was the Peri Peri Chicken, really tender and juicy. The Peri Peri Burger was okay apart from the patty that was relatively dry. Fries and Chunky Chips were freshly fried and they tasted delicious with salt and all those condiments provided. The Gelato was a huge disappointment. Very icy, 1 of the scoops wasn't even compact! Maybe I should have checked the display counter more carefully before I placed the order. The Nata tasted a bit weird, not sure whether that was the authentic Portuguese taste.

Overall, still a fairly positive experience. Will come back for sure, still want to check out some other items on their menu.",2025-07-08 07:28:02,en

The restaurant offers a tasting menu and plenty of drinks options including a wine pairing.
Every single dish was unique on its own way and had some amazing flavours. In addition, each dish was beautifully presented. Some of my personal favourites were the Wye valley asparagus with exmoor caviar and whey sauce, a simple dish but with some unique and delicious flavours. Another favourite was the A5 Wagyu beef with grilled chicory.
There is an option to add a cheese selection before moving onto desserts and it was absolutely worth it, some delicious British cheeses with home made crackers, apple preserve and home made malt loaf.
The desserts were absolutely beautiful and tasted incredible. The sourdough cake with rye custard and brown butter ice cream was loved by everyone on the table. The petit fours at the end were the perfect finish of an amazing dinner. The sunflower seeds macarons and freshly baked madeleines were delicious. The madeleines are baked to order and still warm when served.

The menu is seasonal, with different tasting courses being available depending on time of the year, and produce availability. There is no choice of courses though, but that’s standard for a tasting menu.

Without spoiling the current tasting menu too much, the cod roe starter was incredibly moreish, the custard and roast chicken course was an amazing combination, and the sous vide wagyu steak… well, no words!

Whilst Folium doesn’t have a Michelin star (yet! Surely one must be coming?) it compares incredibly well to those restaurants in the area that do, and should be included in the same category.

The sides and starters all arrived way after our main meals, we ordered salt fish and was given corn fritters because they’d ran out, and our dumplings never arrived, we didn’t get any of the missing or incorrect items refunded, the mac and cheese and plantain arrived ages after all our mains had been eaten, we were planning to eat it all together.

We were a big table and I understand the order was large and I have experience working in food so I know how high stress it can be, so I do understand, however no apology was given and the large delays were not communicated effectively, a lot of this could’ve been resolved with clear communication instead of hostility and lack of accountability.

Unfortunately the service and lack of organisation really let things down, had this side of things been better I would have 100% been a repeat customer as the food was nice! It was also my family members birthday meal so it’s a shame things weren’t up to scratch.",2025-07-07 00:31:33,en

Part 1:

📝: This restaurant/bar opened in Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham a couple years ago. Because my first visit was amazing and I couldn’t fault it, I decided to revisit. However, the  expectation second time round fell short.

The service on a whole was not good. After the waitress took the orders the menu’s were left on the table, empty glasses were also left on the table for the duration of the meal.

When I received my starter 2 hours later it was cold, I also had to wait around 45 minutes to receive drinks. However the cocktails were tasty and we were offered complimentary drinks for our wait.

🍴Starters
- £5.50 Spicy Chicken strips - coating had good flavour, I would order it again, but didn’t like the pepper sauce.

- £6.75 Fricassee chicken wings - balance of flavours was good , the depth of flavours was great you could taste everything you would want in a dish , the food definitely hit the mark.

- £6.75 Barbecue chicken wings - I liked the sweet taste of flavours, it melts in your mouth.

- £8 Jerk King prawns and Avocado salad - was tasty and flavoursome, cooked to perfection a really good dish

- £8 Coconut crisp prawns - They were nice and crispy but needed more coconut as I couldn’t really taste it, the peppered sauce was way too spicy didn’t really like it and it did not go well with the dish. I would of preferred a different sauce.

📝: part 2 - When I received my main course 3 hours later it was warm I was not impressed. I did feel like they struggled to cope with the pressure on Mother’s Day. I would not be in a rush to return as our experience this time round was not a good one. Considering it was Mother’s Day I was extremely disappointed.

🍴Mains
▪️£11.95 Veg curry - It was alright not bad, I would of pereferred potato and yam in the curry but it was just garden veg and peppers , seasoned rice needed a little bit more season as  it was very bland.

▪️£16.95 Peppered steak & white rice - Steak has a sweet taste not spicy , nice strong flavours, the rice was very fluffy And the veg was flavoursome

▪️ £22.95 Steak & rice n peas - my mom ordered the steak cooked medium rare , she was impressed with flavours of the dish especially the mushroom sauce which she thought was lovely and she enjoyed the cherry tomatoes was really tasty

▪️ £14.95 Fried chicken & rice n peas - Chicken & rice was dry needed gravy , food was also warm not hot enough . I would not order it again however the rice n peas was nice and fluffy, if it had gravy it would of gone down like a treat .

🍴Sides
▪️Dumplings  I wish they were cooked fresh as we did wait more than 2 hours for our food

▪️Mac n cheese - this was is nice not too creamy the consistency is  just right , the plantin was sweet but it was hard so not very enjoyable , I would of liked it more soft. Colsesaw I didn’t really like it didn’t give me the wow factor.

▪️£14.95 Bbq chicken & rice n peas - it was nice nothing special, i found it to be warm And I like my food hot with the steam coming off it.

We was welcomed by a lovely young lady who gave us her divided attention which was very nice and appreciated.
The cocktails taste nice but less ice would have been appreciated
The starter of chicken wings was nice with a lovely sticky sauce.
We had the salmon for the mains with vegetables. The salmon was a very small portion and very little flavour and vegetables were bland and again no flavour.
I applaud the business but try to do a little more with the food as I would like you to prosper as I black restaurant and I will come again.

I visited with a friend, and we both agreed that the lady who served us was one of the most strikingly beautiful people we've ever seen.

The food was good, but not exceptional—certainly not enough to justify the price. For two curries, one naan, one rice, poppadoms and two drinks, the bill came to nearly £100. There are nearby places like Shababs that offer more flavour at half the price, which really puts things into perspective.

Service was mixed. The poppadoms arrived quickly, but the mains followed before we’d even finished them, making the experience feel rushed. We had to move everything around to make space, which disrupted the flow of the meal. After finishing, we had quite a bit of food left, but no one asked if we wanted to take it home—it was simply cleared away. We then had to wait quite a while to get the bill.

Overall, while it's better than many takeaways and the setting is lovely, I don't think I'll return. The decor is really the only standout feature compared to other Indian restaurants I've tried.",2025-04-20 08:48:48,en

From start to finish, our experience was nothing short of exceptional. The food was absolutely delicious, and the customer service was truly first class – warm, attentive, and genuine.

We began with a generous serving of crispy *poppadoms*, accompanied by a delightful variety of chutneys and relishes – each sauce brought its own unique flavor, from tangy to sweet to spicy. A perfect way to whet the appetite.

For starters, we opted for the *Chicken Tikka* and *Papri Chaat*. The chicken was incredibly tender, marinated to perfection, and bursting with flavor. The papri chaat was a lovely mix of textures and tastes – crisp, creamy, tangy, and just the right amount of spice. Portion sizes were generous without being overwhelming.

Our mains included *Saag Chicken* and *Paneer Makhani*, served with freshly baked *Tandoori Roti*. Both dishes were outstanding – rich, flavorful, and well-balanced in spices. The saag chicken had a beautiful depth of flavor, while the paneer makhani was creamy and comforting, with a slight sweetness that paired beautifully with the spiced gravy. The medium spice level was spot on for us – just enough heat to excite the palate without overpowering the dish.

For dessert, we shared *Gulab Jamun with Ice Cream* alongside a cup of aromatic *Masala Chai*. The gulab jamun was warm, soft, and syrupy – complemented perfectly by the cool ice cream. The masala tea had just the right blend of spices and sweetness, making for a lovely, comforting end to our meal.

We’re regular diners at places like Dishoom, Asha’s, and Varanasi – and we can confidently say this restaurant holds its own among them. In fact, the level of customer service here may even surpass the others – the staff truly made us feel welcomed and valued.

Looking forward to our next visit – a new favorite on our dining list!",2025-04-21 21:50:26,en

Nepalese/Indian cuisine. We had the vegetarian platter, vegetarian momo and chicken momos for starters all very well presented and super tasty and perfectly spiced. For mains we had one of the chicken curries and Palak Paneer again perfectly spiced and flavourful. The cocktails I’ve got to say are high quality and better than cocktail bars around the city. They are unique and masterfully made. I’d go back just for the drinks. I also had Cobra beer on tap too. To finish we had the dessert platter. Very well presented but the Jalabi and Ras malai could have been a lot better. I’m Indian and know my Indian food well so I feel that most people who haven’t eaten these types of desserts in the past will love them from here.

The star of the show was our waitress. Truly an amazing member of the team. Lovely and polite manner and very funny too and an absolute delight. She made the evening so much better and have to say one of the best waitresses/waiters we’ve ever encountered. She haloed us choose the right things based on what we told her about our tastes.

If you think you’ve experienced the best Sunday roast, think again—because Rav and Jas at The Goat King have completely redefined the game. Their take on the classic roast, elevated with rich, flavorful saag, was nothing short of sublime. Every bite was a masterclass in balance, depth, and creativity. The meat was perfectly cooked, the saag was velvety and packed with warming spices, and the roast trimmings were spot-on.

The service matched the food—warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. Rav and Jas not only brought their culinary expertise to the table but also their passion and hospitality, making the experience feel both elevated and personal.

And the atmosphere? Effortlessly cool, with a buzz that made it feel like the place to be on a Sunday afternoon. Comforting, vibrant, and full of good energy—just like the food.

We both had the same starters and mains, as follows:

Starters"" Fritters of Desire"", consisting of Paneer, Feta , Halloumi, red onion, spinach, cauliflower, aubergine and potato tossed in masala mix fried in chickpea batter.

Ingredients were fresh and very tasty even if the portions were probably twice as large as needed!

Mains: The Goat King Special

Their signature dish, made of slow-cooked pulled goat curry served on and off the bone. Flavored with aromatic spices and herbs to enrich the meat and marrow to succulent perfection.

Served with rice and 2 soft, fluffy fritters, called  'Bhatura' which is a deep-fried leavened sourdough bread originating from the Indian subcontinent.

The goat was beautifully cooked and perfectly seasoned and was definitely some of the best meat I've eaten in any type of restaurant!

The light, rice infused Flying Buffalo Indian lager complimented the goat perfectly.

Rav, the owner/main chef and his wife are really friendly and Rav took time to sit with us & explain a bit about Sikh history and the importance of the food to their culture.

100% recommend The Goat King (also known as 24 Carrot Gold) for anyone wanting a change to their usual curry or mixed grills so popular in Birmingham's many Desi pubs!

The focaccia was delicious, and the goats cheese / beetroot ravioli  was good, but the main pasta dishes were disappointing. I had the crab devon and my mum had the carasecce which in my opinion was undercooked. The crab Devon pasty was too fishy for me, and the carasecce was bland. The paparadelle had okay flavours , but nothing special. The dessert, was genuinely inedible, the poached rhubarb was still so hard, the nut praline didn’t have a great aftertaste and the sauce was very tart. I felt the flavours didn’t compliment at all even if it had been cooked properly.

*Edited to add* We have just been made aware from looking at Trentina’s instagram pictures, that the fennel and black pepper sausage starter my friend was served was nothing like it was supposed to be, as it came without the sauce and cheese. Unfortunately we didn’t take a picture of this but it’s deeply concerning that neither the kitchen team nor our server recognised that we were served a dish where 2/3 key components were missing. Completely unacceptable that we paid full price for this.

The vegan version of the radiatori, chestnut, oregano and old Winchester dish was dry and completely devoid of any flavour. There was no vegan cheese on the dish despite being advertised on the menu. We asked our server if we could get some, and she was told by the kitchen there was no vegan cheese available, something that should’ve been communicated to the front of house team at the start of service so they can inform diners in advance of ordering.

Our server was kind enough to get our dishes swapped to the risotto and spaghetti al pomodoro which were better but still not very impressive in terms of flavour.

Our friend ordered the pappardelle and ox cheek dish and it was not served in a sauce, but basically water. He did ask if this was intentional and it was. Same with the pomodoro as you can see in the picture. Truly baffling why it’s so thin, as you can’t quite mop up the sauce with the focaccia, the watery consistency means it just makes the bread wet.

We also witnessed the table across from us reacting negatively to their food, so we know it’s not just us being fussy!

We did however enjoy our starters, very simple dishes but the flavours were there. The focaccia is good. The drinks were also lovely.",2025-02-10 12:08:56,en

I’ve done both bottomless brunch and a regular dining visit and couldn’t recommend both enough!

Service is always excellent and attentive by staff. Carafes of water are regularly refilled and drinks take no time to come out at all.

The pasta is the real star here, though. Handmade on-site (seriously, if you walk past early enough you can see the magic happen!) and always tasty. I’ve only knocked off a star for food as last time I came my spaghetti was a bit on the undercooked side. Could have done with just one more minute or two to make it perfectly al dente!

I can honestly say the staff, atmosphere and new location is a lot better now that they have moved to the Jewellery Quarter.

Staff seem a lot more friendler and knowledgeable, and provide good customer service. And the atmosphere, location, and products on offer feel a lot better.

They have a good variety of card games, board games, t-shirts, and other merchandise to buy upstairs. Then downstairs is a free console playing area and free gaming tables for playing your own card and board games (though some tables maybe reserved for events). There is even a few free card and board games available for use downstairs too.

I didn't try the food at the old or new location, but from what I have seen they try and offer a good variety of snacks and quick food and drink to keep you going while gaming. If you want proper food or have special requirements - there are lots of pubs, restaurants, cafes etc nearby that may server better food if you want a proper meal beforehand.

I have visited twice. Once to look around and I got a nice Pokémon shirt. Then again to get a pre-release for MTG Wilds of Eldraine, some MTG commander decks, and a nice (now rare!) MTG LOTR playmat.

They have lots of other products though (especially themed around then events they hold).

There are lots of events and casual gaming sessions that look fun to join, and most paid  entry events seem to include a booster pack or a drink.

It is very convenient to have this shop in the Jewellery Quarter, as most geeky shops are in the City Centre or Digbeth. The Jewellery Quarter can be a nice alternative, as it a quieter space with nice architecture, so good for those who don't like crowds/busy areas.

The shop is easy to get to by train and tram (never tried it by bus).

If you get a Daytripper/Network Day Ticket from the bus/tram/train/train stations (it costs around £7.90 after 9:30 am - it includes a days unlimited travel by train, tram, and bus, around most of the West Midlands) you can easily have a look at this shop and other gaming shops in Birmingham to check stock and prices, and have fun around Brum.

My only suggestion to staff is that they need to open a window or put a few air fresheners downstairs, as there is not as much air flow downstairs as there is upstairs. As it is a cellar area, it just needs something to help it out when it gets a bit musty.",2023-09-15 08:04:13,en

Although the shop may cost a few pennies more, the coffee is better quality, better taste & is fresher.
My review:
Soon as you walk in Costa Coffees doors, it’s clean, pristine & pleasant smelling. It will either be almost empty or it’ll be where you can hardly find a seat - depending whether it’s peak times or not. Try to avoid going at peak times/rush hour (like when JQ offices/shops close for the day around 4-5pm). It has a warm, casual, calm vibe. Not like the City Centre chaos of ‘keep your handbag close’ type energy. Store is large, bright and welcoming. There’s usually 1-2 members of staff on so you’re served pretty quickly. (Ensure you scan your Costa Card & get those beans & free drinks!) Menu is high up and easily readable. Ask if you’re not sure/want something custom. It’s their job to assist you & you’re paying so don’t feel shy. Much more menu choices than the Express machines. Regular promotional items come & go (which I love) but they don’t last forever so get them quick! Usually a courteous manner from staff, prompt speed for serving you your drink, served without spillages, lid tight & my custom requests are honoured. Condiments area near to counter, it’s clean & well stocked with all items labelled clearly. This is usually where notices are regarding allergens, recycling info & store info; as well as the bin which I’ve never seen full or overflowing. Lots of seating but I chose to leave with my drinks every time. Big windows to view out of to see Frederick St (retail units, Car Paks complex, Chamberlain Clock & the mini roundabout it’s on) Parking is available right outside, 3-4 spots. This is free after 6pm to 8am & all Sunday, otherwise around £1.50. Pay at machine or RingGo app. Same nearby (Eg Warstone La & Vyse St). There’s Vyse St Multi Storey car park 2min walk away adj to the P.O. It’s technically the same road, just named different as it’s over the mini roundabout. Pricing is about the same & pay the same ways. Best to pay on the App as you can easily extend, not have to worry about finding change nor risk a ticket. I’ve never checked if there’s toilet facilities. I wouldn’t advise making reservations/pre ordering for collection unless it’s a very large order. You’re just going to get cold drinks. Although I’d say it’s kid friendly, it’s not a place for kids (it’s a place for coffee drinkers - which are 100% adults). So unless you have super young babies who just sleep 99% of the time in a pram/holster, very well behaved children or you’re only in for a collection therefore short periods eg - I wouldn’t advise bringing in kids. It’s a place that serves scolding hot liquids that customers set down on tables…. I don’t think you’d want your child/children running around that. Not the place. Pricing is much better than Starbucks by far, & slightly better than Tim Hortons. Prices are not as good as McD’s but DEFINITELY miles better than their quality. Service here meets Costa’s standards overall. I’ve seen better service for Costa in other locations but it’s not bad at all. Wheelchair/scooter friendly as no steps outside, it’s a flat ramp only. They also offer alternatives to dietary requirements. Giving 4/5 for service as I have been left waiting a few times when it’s been empty yet staff finish cleaning up/tending to coffee machines behind the counter/tables etc while I’m at the counter waiting to order. Nothing serious but after 2 minutes, it’s a little rude. Otherwise an excellent branch that no doubt sees 1000’s of customers per week in such a popular area like JQ. Yet still manages to maintain Google star rating of nearly 5. I will be returning to this branch. Recommended",2025-06-15 05:06:11,en

After passing by the restaurant numerous times in the past, we mustered the courage to step inside today, and we were met with exceptional service and delicious food options.

Upon perusing the menu, we sought the guidance of the friendly staff to help us decide on 2 chicken shawarma items. The prompt delivery of our order added to our positive first impressions of the place.

The first dish we sampled was the delectable chicken shawarma served with a side of creamy houmous, while the second was a delightful chicken shawarma wrap brimming with crisp salad and flavorful sauces.

Both dishes exceeded our expectations, boasting juicy and mouth-watering flavours that easily warranted a perfect score of 10/10 in our books.

In addition to the scrumptious fare, we also indulged in a cup of saffron tea, which, though not to our liking, piqued our curiosity to explore other traditional hot drink options on our next visit.

The large menu at the restaurant caters to a wide range of tastes, guaranteeing that there is something to please every palate.

Furthermore, the availability of off-road paid parking ensures a convenient dining experience for patrons.

Booked the experience as a date and we had a fantastic time!
The atmosphere was really calm and chill even with every table occupied. The lighting was soft, bright and beautiful. Song after song that they played really hit the spot. The decor was welcoming and functional (although somewhere to hang coats/bags is a must!).
We were greeted by Esther who led us through the whole process. They were super helpful and friendly without being intrusive which I appreciate.
We picked out our items to paint. We were bracing ourselves for the high prices and still they were more than expected. There were a lot of choices for the items and glaze colours.

Esther gave a short demo and was available to answer further questions throughout the session which we made full use of. Our booking was for a 2hour slot starting at 6pm however we didn't end up leaving until just before 9 which meant we could take our time and our designs weren't rushed.

I would recommend having a think about your design/colour scheme before coming so you can jump right in. We searched for reference photos and used the pencils, brushes and detailing bottles to bring them to life.

It was so much fun!
Also included, were a drink and snack each. Highly recommend the kinder bueno cookie. A vegan cookie was also available as well as a bottomless tea/coffee station.

To reserve your booking, it is £10pp and then on top of that, you pay for your item/s on the day. They are labelled in the photo. We spent £35 each.

Don't let the prices put you off, especially if you enjoy art. We almost didn't go because of it but you aren't just paying for the studio time and blank pottery, you are paying for the whole experience and it is so worth it!!

We are so excited to see our fired pieces in 2 weeks time and probably coming back to do more!",2025-01-18 17:24:10,en

Always passed by this restaurant thinking it's a toned down Indian restaurant serving tiny portions of Indian food, but oh boy, was I blown away.

I've attached my bill, I'd warn you though to get the prawns and lamb chops from the mains section instead of starters/appetisers if you're a party of 3 or more, perhaps a platter. Paneer flavour was amazing, my partner and I specially loved the prawns tandoori and lamb chops. Tender and juicy, well cooked, great use of ghee, just blown away. Shami kebab was alright.

Mains were insanely good, no jokes. The madras sea bream and king prawns biryani blew us away completely. Simple flavours yet seemingly so complex. Nothing overwhelming but really was a taste to behold. Get them without thinking again.

Alas, all good reviews have to come to a bad end. Pina colada was a bit of a let down but not really disappointing. Its just the way I am. I'm extremely critical of my PC's. Sorry to mention but you can probably pop into L*s-Igu*nas next door for it with a 1+1 offer.",2025-04-27 01:38:58,en

Great, unhurried atmosphere, with amazing food! We had the freshest, crispiest poppadoms and dips to begin, followed by a shared starter of Chicken 65, which was exquisite - fresh and light.
For mains, my partner had his favourite, Chicken Madras, which he tells me was one of the best he's had (and he's had a lot!). I had Railway Curry, and was persuaded to have the lamb version instead of my usual chicken - the right recommendation - it was excellent. All washed down with a few Cobras and ciders, with sadly no room for dessert, which sounded equally fabulous. All in all, an excellent place for a curry, we were well looked after and would highly recommend to all. Thank you x",2025-07-15 22:03:24,en

There are numerous rules. You have four sittings. 3 dishes per person plus sides over a 2.5 hour period.

We have dined here many times and the sushi roles are what we recommend. They come in portions of two and are made to order. Colourful well presented and tasty. The sushi roll choice was varied and covered all bases you would need to get lots of variety.

The fried dishes like the octopus balls were very fresh just not to the standard of the sushi. The edamame beans also had a few pods of beans which were hairy & older looking compared to the expected vivid green pods.

It’s £33.80 per person. They said to us that cash was “preferred” but offered no card payment alternative. There is a cash machine across the street so this is not the largest inconvenience. Service charge not applied to the final bill.

The service was slower than expected. But I think it’s because we ordered our second sitting after we finished the previous one and therefore didn’t have the “steady stream” of dishes coming to the table.

In the past, the Bavarian night had a full band performing, creating a lively and fun atmosphere. However, this time, there was just one man (who did his best to be a good host) and one woman, who didn't really add much. As mentioned, the host really was trying and he was fairly funny, but overall it was just a bit “meh”.

At £20 per person, we were expecting a more engaging experience, but it felt lacking in comparison to previous visits. The energy just wasn't there, and despite the host's efforts, it didn't live up to the excitement we were hoping for.

Paid ~£7 for some overly sweet cookie dough with cream cheese and biscoff spread slathered over it. Sounds better than it tasted.

The kitchen area looked really dirty, with a cardboard box full of squares of frozen cookie dough sitting open on the counter. All the staff had dirty aprons and I had to wait 10mins for them to heat one of these chunks of dough.

The portion was way too big for me and I felt like I was going to throw up after eating half of it (might be partially my fault for attempting to eat it myself).

Really wanted to like this place, cookie dough is usually really tasty but this was far from the real thing.

Don't bother going here, try mee-cha bubble tea or the rolled ice cream shops in the bullring instead.",2019-01-17 16:02:17,en

There was a long queue, and the staff seemed under a lot of pressure. It looked like they were short-staffed, and everyone was rushing around. A business can’t operate like that — there needs to be more staff to maintain quality and provide top service.
I’m a regular customer at this store, and I’ve noticed this happening more than once. I also have experience in the food industry, so I understand the importance of proper management. Some managers only care about getting bonuses👎 and don’t pay attention to the staff or service quality.
Honestly, I think the store needs a new manager, because if things continue like this, it’s only a matter of time before the store starts losing customers and its reputation",2025-06-19 14:00:14,en

Those are so delicious and Hot. Especially, we loved their FRIES..!!

I was about to walk away whilst the staff were making it as i was appalled at the little filling they were putting into it. It now also just comes with the pot of salsa dip, no sour cream or tortilla chips, you have to pay extra for that.

I was SHOCKED when I went back in the new year. I asked for a large pork quesadilla and while ordering was not told that this whole medium/large deal had changed and it is only one size medium. While looking at the lady putting the topics I was SHOCKED again to see how little of the salsa and pork was added on, although there was a generous amount of cheese. On receiving my order I was confused - not because I haven’t had the new quesadilla where it is cut into 2 instead of 4 - but because of how tiny and light it was. I went to ask whether it was medium or large - and then was told that it is just one size now. Well, this should’ve been pointed out to me when I asked for ‘large’ so I could’ve ordered a side as well. I’m so disappointed - Tortilla used to be one of my favourites, guess I’ll just have to make the New Mexican places like zambrero and zocalo my new go to. It is actually disgraceful how the quesadilla used to be bursting with toppings - I’m not saying it needs to be that way, but barely putting on any pork and filling it with cheese is NOT the solution. The whole restaurant was empty and rightfully so - I don’t see why anyone would want to pay big bucks for such small portions.",2025-01-08 19:07:35,en

While the the service was reasonably quick despite a busy period, that was the only positive note. The main letdown was the Lavender Matcha Oat Latte. It looked off from the start — nothing like how it’s marketed, lacking the signature vibrant green and lavender tones. In terms of taste, it was even worse: overly milky with barely any presence of matcha or lavender syrup. These are supposed to be the core ingredients of the drink, yet they were either added in negligible amounts or of such poor quality they failed to register, especially the matcha. The drink was bland, diluted, and uninspiring.

The only saving grace in my meal was the Steak Sandwich, which I did enjoy nonetheless. But unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to redeem the experience. Considering the premium prices, I expected consistency and quality. Instead I received a subpar beverage and overall disappointing order. This visit reflect a lack of quality control and poor attention to the brand’s usual standards.

Emmer was honestly nothing short of delightful, very charismatic, very friendly and laid back, and truthfully she made the entire experience so much better. I ordered the crispy fried calamari, thai duck stir fry, and the passion fruit martini. the calamari was delicious and i really enjoyed the stir fry too, i couldn’t finish  the stir fry in the end but i had it packed to take home! as for the drink, a shot of prosecco was served on the side and though i’m new to alcohol it was actually really lovely if i had it with the cocktail :) i was checked in on here and there while eating to make sure i was happy with the food and service which i found really nice. will definitely be coming back for a dessert and coffee next time. i’m really enthusiastic on trying new things so this was my first time at giraffe, i do often get a little anxiety beforehand though but this really did not disappoint. the interior and lights were also a really nice touch.

also please give Emmer a raise or a promotion, she’s amazing and so so incredibly sweet.",2025-03-20 18:58:50,en

They told me at the POS that they do not accept the Starbucks app, which meant I did not get 30% off and had to pay £6.95, which is about £2.00 more than at other stores. I agreed and paid for my order.

At that price, I was at least expecting my order to be correct. The order was passed on to a partner called Bertrik who made my order with ordinary milk, I did ask if it was made with Oat milknandnhe confirmed it was. I did ask for cream; however, he put the cream on the inside of the lid and not on the actual drink. I have never seen that before, so that shocked me. The drink was spilling over the edge of the cup when he finished, and he just passed it to me in a mess, which I had to wipe and clean.

I noticed straight away that before he put the lid on, the top of the drink was pure white. With oat milk, you get a yellow color on top, not white. Also, when I started to drink it, there was no oat milk taste at all, which again is not normal.

I took about three sips and stopped drinking it. I had to go to catch my coach but overall felt like I had been ripped off.

After about 15 minutes, my stomach started to ache as I am lactose intolerant, I can only have a little lactose before it starta hurting my stomach.

Also, on my visit, cross-contamination was witnessed. Bertrik made a frappuccino with a blender that previously had cookies and cream in it and did not wash it before use. My thought at that time was, ""If he is doing this, then he must be doing this with all the pitchers too."" This is a huge concern, imagining that my drink was made in a picter that had not been washed all morning was not a lovely picture in my head.

I hope you take this seriously. I have attached a photo of my Grande white mocha in this email.

Also No name on cup! No thank you on hand off.

Also did not ask for XH!",2025-04-27 10:21:08,en

It's a cashless venue, and you have to order off the QR code, or at least that's what I was told to do anyway.

I was very happy with the buffet as all of it was non-haallal so all options were fine for me. A decent selection of pizza varieties, my personal favourite was the 'nduja one. They do serve beer and wine but I stuck to the soft drink machine as it was included in the buffet. All of the staff were lovely, it's just how busy the place was and the queues where quite overwhelming, as well as lots of little kids running freely and popping up over our booth.

If you're a vegetarian, I'd exercise caution as I did see a child swap a ham pizza into the vegetarian section so although the best care is taken by the restaurant in the way they've set it up, they can't keep an eye on everyone during hectic times.",2025-02-22 17:42:27,en

We ordered three drinks: the Super Berry Smoothie, Passion Fruit Iced Tea, and Passion Storm Smoothie. The Super Berry Smoothie was sweet and refreshing, just as you’d expect from a classic berry blend. The Passion Storm Smoothie had a strong pineapple flavor with a subtle hint of mango, making it a tropical and enjoyable drink. The Passion Fruit Iced Tea was light and refreshing.

The café was quite busy, yet the staff remained incredibly accommodating and kind despite the high-pressure environment. Their efficiency and friendliness made the experience even better.

I pulled her up on this, she totally denied it, although I had seen it with my own eyes.    She then admitted it, telling me she had too much on her mind etc.   She did remake the drink using oat milk, promptly spilling it on the counter and on me.   This was no biggie, I guess, well, not for me,  I just prefer skimmed milk, but as I pointed out to the server, what if this had been a medical dietary need ?? An allergy situation, and she was substituting items, which could have been a dangerous situation.    She couldn't seem to grasp that people could have issues with items being substituted without them knowing what they were getting.

Ordered a flat white and served quickly but the cup was HOT, I then went to add some sweetener and when I took the lid off the milk was way too frothy for a flat white (or even for a cappuccino). I waited 5-10 mins for it to get to a drinkable temperature and it just tasted burnt. Both the espresso and the milk and the texture wasn't what I'd expect at all. Similar milk texture to a Greggs flat white but at least Greggs espresso isn't burnt.

I binned the entire coffee which I hate doing. I'll always try and force myself to drink something I've paid for but it was just bitter. Got a coffee at another nearby spot and there was a world of difference in the care for the process and the final drink.

For the oreo tiramisu and hojicha cream roll, I was expecting a creamy and smooth texture. But the tiramisu was solid hard like frozen cheesecake. Even the cream roll, the sponge cake wasn’t soft enough. The cream was very thick and not airy as I expected.

They offer both hojicha and matcha lattes (and their variations). Their hojicha and matcha are shipped from Japan and at a reasonable price (£4.3+). Tried the mango tiramisu and black sesame tiramisu and they were both banging!! Very light and slightly sweet,  it’s good portion to share between two. Their original tiramisu contains no alcohol, so it’s accommodating for those who can’t consume it! I’ve already came back for a second visit for brunch.

We don’t recommend the fruit ice tea as there’s not much flavours to experience (we ordered the mango). However you can tell the matcha is of some quality and so is the white tea. I definitely recommend to come here and it’s a great place for studying or reading.

Ambience:
The space inside the café is incredibly spacious and comfortable. Most of the seats come with power outlets, making it a perfect spot for working or studying alone! I picked a window seat — great for some casual people watching during breaks, hehe.

🍰Highly Recommended Must-Tries:
1️⃣ Basque Cheesecake – 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Absolutely amazing — rich, smooth, and melt-in-your-mouth perfection. Totally worth coming back for again and again!
2️⃣ Matcha Mochi Pretzel Bun – A must-try for matcha lovers!
The outer crust has a slight chew, while the mochi filling is soft and gooey. Every bite is pure happiness!

☕Coffee Experience:
I ordered an Oat Flat White, and they even let you choose the flavor profile of the beans! If you enjoy fruity acidity, try the other option — but I went for the nutty and chocolaty one, which was totally my kind of flavor. Super satisfying!",2025-07-12 19:26:02,en

The room was comfortable and the location is ideal — just a 15-minute walk to New Street Station and the Bullring, with the Mailbox and central Birmingham attractions only a few minutes away on foot. The hotel itself is well maintained and clean, making for a pleasant base during our visit.

The only downside, and the reason for not giving a full five stars, was the lack of air conditioning. The room was uncomfortably warm and I struggled to get a good night’s sleep due to the heat. If this issue were resolved, it would be a near-perfect stay.

As an example, the waitress dropped cutlery on the table whilst rushing to clear our plates and splashed my hair and dress with curry, but didn't seem very apologetic, only mumbled something about a wipe which I didn't understand - just wanted to leave at that point.
Overall, not sure if I'd come back. The place looks a bit dated and rundown (some seats were dirty, menu pages had folds and stains), not worth the money. For a dinner for 4 paid £150, so better off finding a local curry house.

I was a little uncertain given the odd review mentioning service problems with smaller groups. We were a table of 4 . My fears were quickly dispelled by a really good and well organised front of house team. We particularly liked Victoria’s attentive and charismatic charm throughout the evening.

This was our first visit to Bank and we’re delighted with the menu. Really good starters in fact they were exceptional. Fish was tasty and beautifully cooked. We all enjoyed the cocktails and the setting over the canal was lovely.

Personally I do think the meals are good value give the quality of the produce the presentation and location.

Atmosphere:
Rooftop restaurant, atmosphere is nice and good songs played throughout the dinner. View is pleasant but charged £5 per person for a window seat (came to an extra £10). There is a bar section that plays different songs but this does not interfere with the dining area, seems to be quite lively with people even dancing. There is a smoking area that provides an amazing view too.

Food:
Halal steaks are available if you require this but it is only the fillets. Do not order the calamari below, it is extremely chewy, the batter is stale, the sauce has a weird test (I would rate this 0/10). Steaks are nicely cooked and the peppercorn sauce is good too, mushrooms had a bitter taste, spinach is okay but not reasoned well. Ordered a side of chips and onion rings to share, onion rings are huge and I ordinarily like this style but they were extremely oily, to the point it becomes uncomfortable to eat. Chips were thick cut but also very oily, I would not recommend either of the sides. The only nice thing ordered was the steak.

Service:
Service was professional but we had to call someone over to order which usually does not happen as waiters come over. We also had to wait a while to pay once the bill was received. Other than that the waiters were very nice.",2025-05-31 23:57:32,en

Service was really friendly and the choices of food and drink were incredible, at a reasonable price (even more reasonable if download the app and join the Pizza Express Club!).

We shared a starter of Calamari which was delicious - breaded rather that battered. I had the king prawn laggara and my partner the standard king prawn pizza - both were delicious and we loved it! We were stuffed after so we shared some sorbet for dessert (a scoop of coconut and a scoop of watermelon). For drinks I had a garden gin and tonic, and my partner had a red wine. Both lovely.

Dear Subway Management,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my disappointment regarding a recent experience at your Edgbaston location. During an emergency, I urgently needed access to the restroom. However, I was informed by your staff that I would first need to make a purchase in order to gain permission.

As a regular customer of Subway, I found this policy quite disheartening, especially during a time of genuine need. This experience has left me feeling undervalued as a loyal customer, and I am now considering boycotting Subway altogether.

I believe that customer service should prioritize the well-being of patrons, especially in emergency situations. I hope that you can address this matter and ensure that future customers do not face similar challenges.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Dear Subway Team,

I am writing to share my recent experience at your store on 7th July around 8:00 PM. The store was quiet at the time, with only two or three other customers present. My wife and I had initially planned to dine in. While she was seated, a staff member wearing a black uniform approached us and asked her to change her seat in a very rude and unprofessional manner.

We found this behavior extremely disappointing and chose to leave and dine elsewhere. I still decided to use my Subway points to purchase water bottles, but the same staff member refused this as well, which added to our frustration.

I believe the individual in the black uniform might be the manager. If that is the case, I am genuinely concerned about how someone with such poor customer service skills is leading the team. Respectful and courteous behavior should be a priority, especially from management.

I hope this feedback is taken seriously, and the staff member is advised to treat customers with basic respect and professionalism in the future.

Thank you for your time and understanding.",2025-07-10 13:35:20,en

Sitting drinking Friday afternoon/evening when a staff bar member came over and asked for the chairs - we said yes of course as we didn’t need them. He said no yours - move.. my husband said no.. iv just bought drinks and I’m sitting here to drink them. He went over to the bouncers and then they came over and asked him for a word.. he walked over to the door with them for a word and they grabbed him. 3 on 1.. dragged him to the floor like a rag doll.. and in that when he got up they were backing down as he was ready to start.. which at this point everyone from the table had gone over as we knew it was bang out of order… It’s disgusting how you could treat people like that and for what reason.. he had done nothing wrong whatsoever.. the 1 bouncer apologized to us and he said he didn’t know what had happened and he would try and sort it. I have since emailed you and rang - left several messages for a returned call and nothing.. I will never be coming back here.. it speaks in volumes really for what does actually happen here doesn’t it!!! Bruising to my husbands neck and skin scrape/swelling/bruising to his ankle!! Nothing will be done about this… but I would sure love to see your CCTV of how it happened so you know your staff are at fault!!! You need sacking!!!!,2025-07-21 18:57:11,en

Ordered food at the table on the app. Food was nice. We had:

Scampi and sweet potato fries
Festive burger
Fajita chicken pasta

Despite this, I later received a letter from a third-party company (ForecourtEye) claiming I had stolen fuel — an accusation based solely on the word of the garage manager. I have provided bank statements proving I paid the full amount, yet they continue to pursue me, refusing to supply any receipt, CCTV or breakdown of what was sold.

To make things worse, they’re claiming I purchased AdBlue, which is impossible — I drive a petrol Vauxhall Corsa, which doesn’t use it!

This is disappointing, as it creates confusion and poor customer service for Amazon users. If the petrol station cannot handle Amazon services effectively, they shouldn’t partner with Amazon.

We walked into Barajee as casual diners, and as soon as we mentioned we didn’t have a booking, the staff’s tone became noticeably cold and dismissive. No one asked about allergies or dietary preferences, and when we requested food recommendations, we were met with a blunt “no.”

Interestingly, once I started taking notes for this review, the tone of service shifted — suddenly more polite and attentive, which came off as performative.

Food:
•	Condiments were overly sweet.
•	Chicken Pakora lacked seasoning. The chicken was cooked fine, but the flavor was bland and the plating unimpressive.
•	Lamb Tikka was cold, chewy, and tasted microwaved. Not tender and poorly presented.
•	Chicken Madrasa was hot and the chicken was well-cooked — probably the best part of the meal.
•	Garlic Naan was sweet, not crunchy, and lacked butter.

At the end of the meal, we were given cheap-tasting chocolates and hot towels. The beer was standard.

When the server asked how the food was, I gave honest feedback. He responded by saying that the food is “only targeted to few people,” which was an unprofessional and unnecessary remark — and honestly left a bad taste.

Overall, the experience felt inconsistent, awkward, and disappointing. Not somewhere I’d return.",2025-04-07 02:05:49,en

Staff were friendly, attentive and helpful and I can't fault them.

Order needs to be placed via a tablet on your table. I'm not a big fan of this concept but went with it. I found it quite difficult to order what I had seen on the menu as the two didn't appear to match completely, but that could have been down to my use of the app. Another issue I have with the Tablet order and pay system is I have to instantly decide on my level of tip ... Before I have even seen my food or had a complete service. This seems a bit silly to me.

Food came and the fries were fabulous. I can't help but be disappointed by the chicken burger and onion rings. Burger was very small for the price and was essentially a piece of fried chicken breast, with some over chewy and crispy areas. Onion rings were hard and too crispy and some of the onion was a bit rough.

I had a coke with my meal, the choice of alcoholic drinks was very limited, I think there was only Cruz Campo available (wouldn't swear to this).

Overall for a meal which cost me £31.19 including a service charge of 12.5%, other than the excellent fries I would probably prefer a chicken burger from McDonald's or Burger King. This could be just down to personal preference, but I am giving an honest appraisal of my meal and experience here.

Again staff were 5 ⭐, but meal and overall experience disappointing.",2025-05-30 07:45:20,en

Most of the food spots around this area seem to be chains, and I could not find any smaller independent places, which I usually prefer to support.

That said, this chain actually surprised me with the quality of the food. It was much better than I expected. The service, however, was nothing special. I was not a fan of the tablet-based ordering system, especially as we had major issues when it came to paying.

I would return to a GBK, but only if the food is consistent across other branches, as I was genuinely happy with the meal. The downside is the price. For a chain restaurant, it felt quite expensive, and to be honest, not entirely worth it. While some of the food is cooked fresh to order, it still feels quite standardised, and you do get the sense that not everything is made from scratch in the branch. The service also did not really add much to the experience.

At that price point, I would usually expect to be supporting a smaller independent burger place where more care goes into the food and where the chefs likely have a bit more skill and flexibility in how things are prepared.",2025-07-06 22:47:30,en

A male staff member acknowledged me with a nod, but no one ever came to take my order. I waited patiently for 10 minutes, yet still, no one approached.

Thinking perhaps the restaurant required online ordering, I tried placing an order via your online system. However, I received an error message saying that this table number was not recognized by the system. This was incredibly frustrating and unacceptable.

We waited 25 minutes to be sat down and whilst waiting nobody spoke to us. We were a reserved table of 6 and the waitress ROSIE clearly didn’t care about her job, she was rude and senseless to us.

When we were FINALLY sat down we were placed at a table for 4!!!! Whilst there was an empty table for 6 with nobody sat at it. ROSIE then proceeded to place a couple and a table for four at said table for 6.

This really upset us as ROSIE didn’t even apologise to us and when we asked for another table she simply walked off.

When we spoke to LAUREN the manager we were then told that the couple that were sat AFTER us at said table for 6 were regulars and neither LAUREN or ROSIE apologised to us.

In fact ROSIE persisted to seat other people at 6 seater tables purely out of pettiness until we decided to move ourselves to one.

Nobody came and asked us how our food was and apart from AMRIT who seemed much more with it and helpful, we were treated with cold responses.

I personally don’t see how one cannot count to 6. However, be that as it may, the service that we were given was the worst customer service I have EVER received.

⭐⭐⭐⭐

We recently visited Varanasi Restaurant on Broad Street to celebrate my wife’s birthday, and it turned out to be a fantastic experience from start to finish.

The ambiance was elegant and inviting, with beautiful decor that instantly set the mood for a special evening. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive throughout our visit, making sure everything was perfect for the occasion.

We thoroughly enjoyed the food – every dish was bursting with flavour and presented beautifully. From the starters to the mains, everything tasted authentic and delicious. The cocktails were equally impressive!

Let me tell you why.

For a spend of £15-£18 there are much better places. McDonalds, Smashburger, Burger & Sauce, Nandoes all have better food for a lesser price. In these places it will cost you likely less than that for a meal. You get delicious fries, burgers, anything and usually very well made.

For £18 I got a paper bag with a burger that had a very cold bun and overly chewy beef. One side of it was absolutely caked in sauce so much it was really messy to eat and ingredients constantly slipped out. All of this was wrapped in a foil like I were having a packed lunch.

Then over that foil-wrapped burger was a cup of fries and a ton more fries dumped on top. As for the drink it was great but that's a given since it's dispensed from a freestyle machine.

The flavour was fine but nothing great. It had the All In ingredients and tasted nice and the chips were fine too but the price is a huge let down for me along with how the burger was served. Would have much rather gone to Nandoes or Smashburger.

For a £8-10 meal, great if the burger is served properly. For the £15-18 mark absolutely not.",2022-07-26 19:31:52,en

I anticipated we may be slightly late so emailed to ask if we could move the brunch forward 30 minutes however no one responded.

We managed to arrive at our original time and drink and food orders were taken promptly. The food was nice and the variety of drinks kept everyone happy. Service was prompt.

Our brunch was due to finish at 3.30pm so the waitress came over at 3pm and said the brunch is finishing soon so can I get you some more drinks then I'll take your final order after that. Throughout the brunch we had been finishing our drinks in around 5-7 minutes. The waitress arrived at 3.15pm with our last drinks then promptly took payment for the brunch. We still had 15 minutes left of our 90 minutes, which we believed we could have easily had one more order. I have been to most of the bottomless brunches in Birmingham and also other places in the UK and usually the last order is taken at the end of the brunch.

When we questioned this, we were advised that our time started from when we started drinking, so my friend stated that we placed our drinks order at 2pm and didn't start drinking til after 2pm if that was the policy and the waitress said ""well I took your order at 2pm."" The argument we had was that we still had 15 minutes left of our brunch and they were taking our payment trying to get us off the table before the 90 minutes was up.

The food was more like a nibbling stuff (or cheap fast food) rather then a proper buffet style (not sure what the company paid for, so can't base my review on this, but I believe was around £35/person).
Haven't seen the real distillery (as we were based on the ground floor and the distillery/bar on the basement).

Title: Deeply Disappointed – Would Not Recommend

We were genuinely excited to host our wedding here, but the experience fell far short of expectations. The air conditioning in both the venue and rooms was completely inadequate — the unit was visibly dirty, leaking, and not cooling the space, causing our £600 wedding cake to collapse by the evening. This was especially frustrating as we had been told it would be fine if the room was climate-controlled — which it clearly wasn’t.

There was no proper duty manager after 7 PM despite prior assurances. When issues came up later in the evening — such as missing food allergy labels — there was no one clearly in charge to handle it.

The hotel stay was also a nightmare. We had to get our room keys sorted six times, staff seemed unaware of our bookings, and the room aircon didn’t work, forcing us to leave the balcony door open all night. Since our wedding, we’ve seen similar reviews which confirms these are recurring problems.

After the event, we raised all these issues and asked to escalate the complaint. Our request was ignored, and the response we received was dismissive.

A wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime occasion — and we left feeling let down, stressed, and incredibly disappointed. Based on our experience, we would not recommend this venue to future couples.",2025-06-21 13:44:57,en

The hotel accepted the booking weeks ago and only sent a notice of broken AC the night before our stay. When I saw the message I assumed it must have been a new/temporary issue but I have now seen lots more reviews raising this point.

Some reviews mentioning broken AC are from 1 month ago, 2 months ago - the one from 2 months ago mentions reviews from months before that!

Clearly the issue is known to the hotel, so they should absolutely not be accepting bookings.

I am not exaggerating when I say the hotel is uninhabitable in its current condition.

POOR SERVICE!!
POOR ROOM CONDITIONS!!

I stayed at this hotel for my wedding, expecting a comfortable and enjoyable experience, but unfortunately, I was met with poor service.
Raising complaints will be a waste of time because they will not follow up with you.

* Room Conditions: The room was extremely hot and uncomfortable. I had no option but to sleep with the balcony door open, which made the room very noisy throughout the night, affecting my ability to rest.
* Poor Room Maintenance: The curtains in the room were falling apart, contributing to a substandard experience that was far below what I anticipated.
* Check-in Problems: Upon arrival, I was given the wrong key card and had to check in again to resolve the issue.
* Access Issues and Poor Customer Service: My sister’s key card stopped working at around 9 PM. She attempted to find staff at reception on six separate occasions, and nobody was available until much later. When someone was finally located, she was issued a new key but was then told that no one should be staying in the room – despite the room having been paid for. This left her confused and concerned.

Very disappointed and would not recommend. If I knew that this was gonna be the case i would have 💯 chose a different hotel for my wedding.",2025-06-25 08:02:01,en

My family and I had the sushi buffet. This was my first time coming here and it will be my last as well unfortunately. But I’d love to express my honest opinions about this place!

The positives were that the staff were fairly friendly, doing their job as they should. And although I didn’t have the teppanyaki, the people who did have it seemed to be enjoying it and the atmosphere and the performance from the chefs over that side of the restaurant seemed nice. However, I can’t say much about the teppanyaki since I didn’t have it.

On the other hand, there are many areas where this restaurant could improve in my opinion. First of all, the food quality is nowhere near as good as it could be. It’s very average and feels a little lacklustre, as said by not just myself but my family as well. We were served a sushi platter, some prawn tempura and noodles. The best thing out of the things we ate at the restaurant was the actual sushi. It was at a better standard than the rest of the food in my opinion. The prawn tempura was okay, nothing special, but the noodles were not what I expected. Perhaps I am in the wrong for expecting something else but we got Chinese style stir-fry noodles. I work in a Chinese takeaway so I’m aware what Chinese stir-fry noodles are like. So it was honestly very average tasting. We decided to leave after trying the noodles because we really weren’t feeling it. Another thing I’d like to say is that the sushi conveyor belts weren’t used which was a little disappointing but not a big deal for me. However, I did read some other reviews that say that they never turn the sushi conveyor belts on, which is a shame.

Overall, it was a very average experience and I wouldn’t come again, mainly because the quality of food that I experienced just isn’t up to my standard. Every restaurant has areas of strengths and areas of improvement. So I just wanted to express my honest review of my experience as unbiased as possible. Thank you to the friendly staff who served us today!",2025-03-30 17:00:51,en

I ordered the medium ribeye steak, and it was cooked to absolute perfection, juicy, flavourful, and tender. I also had a cocktail called Strawberry Fields, with a touch of elderflower, and it was truly mind-blowing, refreshing and beautifully balanced.

The table and surroundings were spotless, and the quality of the meat was very impressive.

The last time we went was before lockdown, and the cafe has definitely had a glow up. We ordered the Full Veggie Breakfast: which consists of two vegan recipe sausages, quarter avocado, fried egg, flat mushroom, grilled tomato half, hash brown, Heinz Baked Beans and toast. They gave the option to swap out any of the items for something else, and we chose to swap out the egg and sausages for extra hash browns, as the hash browns from the Morrisons Cafe are unbeatable! The hash browns were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, the perfect hash browns!

The interior of the cafe was spacious and there was plenty of seating area. There were tables for two as well as tables for larger groups, which we thought was very convenient. We were sat at a table near the window, so we had a view whilst we were having brunch.

Where breakfast meets bargain and the pints flow freer than the traffic outside.

Dropped into the Figure of Eight on a brisk Birmingham morning—Broad Street still yawning from the night before—for a no-fuss traditional breakfast. Verdict? Somewhere between average and actually-not-bad-at-all. But here’s the thing: for the price, it was more than adequate—it’s Wetherspoons, not The Ritz.

You know the drill: sausage, egg, beans, toast, and hash browns that could stop a hangover in its tracks. The coffee? Bottomless. Refill ’til your soul stops screaming. It’s a JD institution, like sticky menus and gents debating politics at 10am.

Now, let’s talk booze. Cheapest in the land. You could build a pyramid of pints for the price of a single cocktail elsewhere. And there’s something comforting about that classic Spoons setup—wooden booths, sticky floors, and a drinks menu as thick as a Dickens novel.

In summary:
Not a culinary pilgrimage, but for a breakfast with caffeine on tap and change left over for a cheeky morning lager, the Figure of Eight does exactly what it says on the tin. And then some.

Rating: 7/10 – mostly for the price, the bottomless brew, and the familiar Spoons charm.",2025-07-07 11:08:16,en

A mixed race girl then got involved and told me they can’t do anything about it as I should have collected the food! The restaurant was near empty! They could have had the courtesy to give me a nudge to pick up my food rather than just let it stand there for 18 minutes and get cold!

I recently visited this Costa Coffee in Birmingham city centre while staying nearby for a meeting. It was a fantastic experience — the coffee was excellent and a perfect way to freshen up my morning. The atmosphere in the shop is warm and inviting, and I truly enjoyed my time there.

The location is right in the heart of town, surrounded by a lovely area that adds to the overall charm. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better.

If you’re in Birmingham, I highly recommend stopping by this Costa Coffee. It’s a great spot to relax, recharge, and enjoy a great cup of coffee.

Not long to wait and found a vacant table inside... 🙂

We had hot chocolates and they were fantastic.

Some other customers with a young child got up and left a right mess on their table and floor and just walked out !!  (which I find appalling, they must live in a dustbin to think that's acceptable in any Society) I tried to hint about the mess they were leaving as they were dusting broken crisps off their child into the floor and table but it just bounced off them... If it was my shop I'd have given them a broom before they left !!

The young lady who was on duty just took it in her stride to clean up after these vagrants.

After a short time I noticed this same young lady go outside where a small female child had accidentally dropped her drink and was looking quite upset...

She helped clean up the mess and then made the girl another drink...

Definitely above and beyond from this Costa team member and the drink was great too. 🙂",2022-04-19 15:13:10,en

However, on my recent visit to watch Superman, I booked the Dolby screening at Screen 3, and was disappointed to see that the projector was showing a blue hue on the righthand side of the screen. This was noticeable not just during the adverts, but also during the film. Considering Dolby is their premium option, which they charge £19 for, there shouldn’t be issues with the screen, and if there is then that should’ve been disclosed and reflected in the price.

Today, for the first time, Olivia reached the very top of the wall — she was over the moon! It was a proud and joyful moment, and I could truly see a love for climbing beginning to grow in her. I’m so grateful for Chantal and the Rock Up team. You’ve planted a climbing seed in my child’s heart, and we’ll be back every week to nurture it.

The food came in a timely manner and it was of the right temperature and it tasted delicious. The only hiccup was that I washed for hollandase sauce to be on the side instead of the top of my eggs but they misunderstood and gave me an extra Hollandese sauce. Despite that I still enjoyed the food.

It's cost and wholesome food!
We were in town for a show and came here for breakfast. The menu looked good and the food did not disappoint!
We had parked about 10 mins away and I didn't see any parking local to this cafe, so make plans before hand if you are traveling by car.
We were welcomed warmly and within moments seated. It looks small but has a surprising amount of space. Which it needs as it was very popular and filled up pretty quickly!
You order by scanning the QR code, which seems to becoming the norm these days.
When the food came it looked amazing and tasted just as good. It has a lot of options for vegetarians!
A point about the coffee! It was lovely! Usually I end up adding a little sugar to dull the bitter taste, but here it tasted amazing! Just right!
Highly recommend this place but I'm guessing when the weather is better, this place is that much more in demand.
Definitely one I saved to come back to when in the area again.

The female,  staff member then walked towards the till, just at the point that a woman arrived beside me to also wait in line. Instead of serving me, she began to serve this whiter, lighter woman. I told her excuse me I’ve  been waiting to be served (as though this needed some explanation for my waiting by the till) and this staff member rolled her eyes, as though I was an inconvenience for asserting my rights. To add to this, the other customer afterwards began glaring at me! It was Luke, the manager, arriving afterwards to work out, diligently if the hot chocolate powders were vegan, that has made this experience less bitter. I’m so tired of having to decide whether to raise a complaint and be seen as an angry, Black/Brown woman causing a fuss or just ‘compartmentalise it’ and go about my day. I chose the latter.

Extremely disappointed. Firstly initially when I arrived, there was two staff behind the counter and only one other customer in front of me. It was almost 20 minutes until I managed to get my drink. This was a combination of reasons. The lady who was initially making the previous customer drinks was so painfully slow I felt compelled to ask her if she would like me to take over but managed to refrain. Then the male worker decided he would make my order. I think this was with good intentions and through sheer social awkwardness for how slow his colleague was being. He attempted to make a my skinny latte and failed. I was eventually given a cup full of froth only having waited for around for seemed like an eternity. I instantly handed this back, he was very polite and apologetic but this was still frustrating, he then began to remake my drink and hadn’t even started on the second drink that was with my order. Long story short the drink tasted vile and went in the bin and so did my sons hot chocolate. Never had a bad Costa in my life until yesterday. £7.50 down the drain. Really annoying and disappointing. I would advise others use the other Costa around the corner as it’s more efficient and not disappointing at all.",2022-05-19 06:48:26,en

The Moseley Arms offers a practical and generally pleasant experience for a city centre stay in Birmingham, earning a solid 3 out of 5 from my visit. It's a good choice if you prioritize convenience and a lively atmosphere over luxury, but it does come with a few caveats.
The Good:
* Location is King: Without a doubt, the prime advantage of The Moseley Arms is its location. Nestled in Digbeth, it's incredibly close to major transport links like Moor Street and Grand Central stations, making arrival and departure a breeze. For those heading to the Custard Factory or O2 Institute, or simply wanting to explore the Bullring, it's perfectly situated for easy access. The free on-site parking is also a significant bonus in such a central area.
* Friendly Faces: The staff deserve a special mention. They were consistently welcoming, helpful, and efficient, contributing significantly to a positive overall impression. Service at the bar and check-in/out was always prompt and friendly.
* Pub Vibe: If you appreciate a traditional pub atmosphere, you'll feel right at home. The bar area is lively, offering a good selection of drinks. We didn't sample the full food menu beyond some snacks, but the general buzz was enjoyable.
The Alright (and what holds it back from a higher score):
* Room Comfort (Just About): Our room was clean and had the essentials – an en-suite, TV, and tea/coffee facilities. However, it was fairly basic. While perfectly adequate for a short stay, the general wear and tear were noticeable, and a refresh wouldn't go amiss. We also found the sound insulation to be a bit lacking, meaning we could hear some of the pub's activity and fellow guests, though it wasn't overly disruptive during our midweek stay.
* Breakfast (Average): We opted for breakfast, which was convenient but fairly standard fare. Nothing to write home about, but it filled a gap before a day of exploring. It's an additional cost, and while not unreasonable, it didn't feel like particularly good value for what was offered.
* Noise Potential: While we didn't experience excessive noise, it's clear that on a weekend, with live entertainment running, this could be an issue for light sleepers. During our stay, the general pub chatter was audible but not intrusive.
The Verdict:
The Moseley Arms is a perfectly decent option for a short, functional stay in Birmingham, especially if you're attending an event nearby or just passing through. Its fantastic location and genuinely friendly staff are its strongest assets. However, don't expect a luxurious or particularly quiet retreat. It does what it says on the tin – a convenient city pub with rooms – and for that, it earns a solid 4 out of 5.",2025-07-15 09:38:15,en

I had the Pineapple Express burger with the ODB fries, and my husband went for the Louisiana Slammer, added a beef patty to it (one of the specials) with buffalo fries. Let me just say, the food exceeded our expectations.

Everything came out hot, fresh, and full of flavour. The burgers were juicy and perfectly cooked, and the fries were next-level good. But overall, I have to give a special shoutout to the sauce on the Pineapple Express—it totally made my day. I ended up going back up and ordering a side of it just to have more!

The food for the most part was good
My only negative was concerning the portion size for certain plates.

I understand fine dining,
But 4 bite size prawns for eleven great British pounds is really poor.

That, plus the ‘wagyu’ burgers were really mediocre and did not live up to expectations nor justify the price tag. I was disappointed with said items to say the least.

Onto the 3rd and final lounge on my Birmingham tour, ended up at Le Mirage. Upon entering we were asked to take a seat anywhere we liked so we decided to seat in these booth style sofa right at the end, seating was comfortable. Decided to order something we haven’t tried before so green ice pops it was. Shisha came out within 10 minutes in a old school ice chamber pipe, might be a KM but unsure we were also given disposable pipes. Shisha was good but the flavour died down within 30-40 minutes and this was because of the Egyptian head they use I tend to find these types of bowls give off a more harsher smoke. Lounge was big in size with plenty of seating. Price since you are in Birmingham is pretty decent and cards are accepted. Parking is a bit difficult as the roads have parking restrictions but if there’s a space on the pavement you just dump your car there. Vibe was good it was getting busier just as we were leaving.

It's very attractive to visit.Excellent location for the hippodrome theatre.
They certainly coped with a busy pre theatre lunch session.Limited menu.
Staff were helpful,at times we felt at little over stretched.
Food,in the main all good.Little touches would have raised the bar.
The sea bass was very good,but had been dried out around the edges,from the pass,which given it was busy was odd.
Lasagna,good,but lacking that crispy finish.Not exceptional.
Everything arrived hot.
Calamari,good, little rubbery.
Things like putting olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the tables would be a nice touch.
Mains came with a salad
The desert's we had were excellent  have to say,my lemon based one,one of the best I eaten.

My order number was 1070, placed around 5:16 PM. Before I could even order, I waited at the counter for five minutes. When I politely inquired if orders were taken there, a staff member responded with shocking rudeness. She snapped, 'Do you not know how to use a kiosk?' making me feel incredibly foolish.

I explained that the last time I used a kiosk, it didn't accept cash. Instead of assisting, she barked several things at me, refused to take my order, when i stuck up for myself. and warned, 'Don't get me mad!' I was appalled by her aggressive tone, especially since I had done nothing wrong. It felt as though she was taking out her frustrations on me, which is completely unacceptable. I've worked in fast food myself and never treated a customer with such disrespect.

Her behavior made me feel violated. Had I not really wanted KFC, I would have walked out immediately. When I asked her colleague for her name the orignal staff member intervened again, shouting, 'Ask me, innit? I'm here!' in a threatening manner. When I asked her name, she said it was 'Rebecca,' but something tells me that wasn't her real name, as she was the only one without a name tag. In the whole kfc branch.

This employee's inappropriate, almost gangster-like behavior is unacceptable for someone in a customer service role. She needs to be held accountable for her actions and, frankly, should be terminated. No customer should be subjected to such treatment.",2025-07-09 17:34:33,en

A massive improvement and change from what it once was, the burgers are now fully cooked, fresh and fast, the location itself provides itself a nice central placement in the bull ring - this allows a get away from the chaos of what is going on outside.

Tables are often kept neat and tidy, with the staff putting in a world of effort to ensure consistent and high quality is being delivered.

The burgers taste standard for burger king, which is a good thing, they are well cooked and consistently delivered at high level, all customisations are adhered to.

Located close to the burger king is a car park that charges £2 for parking.

Although the machines are still placed in an odd location, the tables set around the restaurant have been moved slightly and now make more logical sense, beyond this, the upper level of the restaurant seems to have been permenately closed.

There is disability access available.

This is vastly different from the burger kind I made a visit to a while ago, same brand, same staff, but new vibe and a strong positive energy; a lot of respect as this is often hard for a branch to do.

Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area and want a quick bite.",2024-06-20 10:32:41,en

Only 5 taps but your top up card is valid whenever you go back. Fridge of local craft beer, soft drinks and they do coffee.

Small venue tucked in the corner and very close to Z roberto's which does some super rare beers, so this place is cool for a few local draft beers before moving on to other locations.

We both went for a fresh juice mine was the energise one with kiwi , apple and spinach,  and a matcha latte.

When everything arrived it tasted fresh and perfect. We spied other plates going out and they too looked flawless. If I had the room I would have also ordered one of their stunning cinnamon buns too.

For the food I ordered the salt beef cubano, which was really delicious but I did wish it could have a little more sauce (a personal preference!). My friends also really enjoyed their dishes, like the full breakfast and the avocado toast. Everyone serving us was super friendly and welcoming, like the lady who took our order and told us we could ask for drinks not on the menu and Fatima who served us our food and told us how it was all freshly made that morning!

We were late for our reservation by around 10 minutes but there was no fuss when we walked in we were taken straight to our table. We already had a look at the menu online before so we knew what we wanted so we ordered (kitchen for brunch was closing at 2:45) and everything came out soo quick!!

Now where the service really excelled was in the staff. I didn’t get the name of the really lovely girl taking our order but if you suggested the whole ice cream, olive oil and sea salt combination (I haven’t tried it yet but I will!!) just know you really went above and beyond for us that day and we all really appreciated it. The bartender even made me a custom ice tea (which I definitely think should be a menu item because it was DELICIOUS). Another staff member called Fatima also told us that all dishes are freshly made each day like the focaccia bread we were having, and all the dishes are halal too!

The vibes were truly immaculate at this place, such cute interior design it was perfect for a hot summers day. They were also selling (quite big) ice cream cones for only £1.50 with your choice of sauce and toppings?? I mean if you haven’t been sold on the food and staff already at least come for the ice cream.

All in all, I definitely recommend this place for a brunch with anyone. But also I’m planning to go for tapas and sunday roast  too as recommended by Fatima because this place can do no wrong in my eyes, it deserves its flowers and I’m regretful to not have tried this place out sooner.

Very rude staff.
First of all, the bun that I had ordered was very dry and was lacking in the flavour department.
The chai latte was appalling, it tasted like straight up sweet milk - I would not recommend this especially if you are cultured. There was no spice whatsoever.
The mushroom pastry was decent yet very, very greasy.
And lastly, there was some form of cronut that we had ordered that was so hard and tough to get into - you’d need a chainsaw just to cut it up! Originally we thought we’d take this dessert to go, yet shortly changed our minds. A couple of minutes after, the manager decided to berate us for eating that one dessert in (bearing in mind everything else we had ordered to eat in). Never had a staff member assume the worst like that before and humiliate us for no apparent reason like that in our lives - would never go back! Even after the ordeal, she would keep giving us evils and dirty looks until we left.

The texture is so dry and quite tough to cut through and taste stale. We even asked the waiter about it if it’s supposed to be like that he just said well it’s a cronut and it’s like that. We did say it’s not our first time eating one. He said it’s probably the kitchen. Not even an offer to change it or what. In short the service was as dry as the cronut we had. The icing on top was too sweet and grainy and more artificial in taste. The maple and pecan was not too bad or great either, better texture but it lacks the maple syrup taste.

I decided to treat myself, and I'm so glad I did. The mango ice drink was absolutely divine, seriously the most refreshing thing ever on a warm day. It was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy, and I practically inhaled it! I also grabbed a muffin, and let me tell you, it was super yummy and perfect with the drink. The texture was spot-on, and it was clearly fresh. The staff were pretty okay too, nothing to complain about, just doing their job. Overall, it was a lovely experience and I'll definitely be back for more mango ice drinks! (especially in summer!)🧃☀️🌡",2025-07-13 10:20:49,en

I turned up at the opening time of 10am and was pleasantly surprised to see there was no queue. Turned out I was at one of two entrances, the main one appears to be inside the shopping centre. The indoor entrance is prioritised to open first, so when we got in and got to the desk, we were shown the actual queue and joined the back of it. Luckily it wasn't too long, and we were handed out chocolates while we waited.

There are two courses, a tropical one, and an ancient explorer one. We did seriously consider doing both, but decided last minute to just go on the tropical one. This turned out to be for the best, as one round was enough for us. It was £40 for us as a family of four. There are lockers which are free to use, where we put our coats.

You play each hole in turn behind other groups, and there's a rule to keep each player to a maximum of 6 shots to keep it moving. You could see some ahead of us ignoring that rule, but I was more concerned with the family behind us who ignored their children getting ahead of them and constantly disrupting our game. This obviously isn't the fault of the venue, but just something to look out for.

It was nice to sit down and relax with a cold beer in their restaurant area afterwards, but I didn't try any of the food so I can't comment on that.",2025-02-21 19:06:02,en

I visited the Bullring Bubbleology branch on 28th June and was quite disappointed with the experience. Upon arrival, I was greeted by an older gentleman standing at the counter with the menu turned off. He informed me, rather abruptly, that “we only have fruit teas.” I accepted that and proceeded to place my order. However, the drink I received was room temperature and tasted like tap water with some popping boba – not what I expect from a £5 bubble tea. It was so underwhelming that I ended up throwing it away.

Hoping this was just an off day, I returned during the following week and had a much better experience. I was greeted politely by a young lady with glasses and a long name, who was professional and courteous. This time, I ordered a mango milk tea and it was cold, flavourful, and actually worth the money.

I understand if a store is running low on ice or ingredients – these things happen. But being served a warm fruit tea at 4pm, when the store closes at 8pm, just comes across as careless and lazy. I hope management ensures a more consistent level of quality and service across all shifts.",2025-07-13 00:35:06,en

I wanted to see and try why so many people were willing to wait. The café itself is quite small, and it’s definitely hard to get a seat, especially during busy hours. When I finally got my coffee, I have to say I didn’t feel anything particularly special about it. It was decent, sure, but not something I’d personally queue that long for. That said, the staff were very friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy if you manage to get a spot.

What I noticed:
•	✅ Very friendly and polite staff
•	✅ Cozy, warm vibe inside (though cramped)
•	❌ Coffee was average—not bad, just not standout
•	❌ Very small place, seating is limited
•	❌ Long queue, not sure it’s worth the wait

The server was very nice but there was only one person taking orders and making the drinks which made it slow, especially since it’s a busy area. This would have been fine if the drinks were nice but they were not.

I love bubble tea and seeing as it was my first time trying this place I went for the usually safe order of a brown sugar milk tea. However it was so watered down. I’ve had bubble teas before that just tasted like milk but this wasn’t even milk, it was watery milk.

And the whole point of a brown sugar is the syrup, which I chose after looking at the poster picture displaying the drink with  having lots of syrup all along the inside of the cup. In reality I couldn’t even see any syrup. I know pictures can exaggerate a bit but this was just false advertising. It was just brown watery milk with no syrup and the tapiocas were sticking together as well.

Also two of the drinks I asked for warm, as the sign specifically showed they offer both hot and cold, but what I received was just room temperature. I was disappointed.

The atmosphere was relaxed but lively, and I could tell a lot of people there were regulars – always a good sign. I left feeling full, happy, and already planning my next visit.

My first venture into Elio Cafe, nestled in the heart of the Mailbox, proved to be a truly delightful experience. Stepping inside, I was immediately struck by the sophisticated atmosphere. The interior design is undeniably beautiful, with a clear emphasis on creating a refined space. The high ceilings are a masterstroke, instantly lending an air of grandeur and elegance that elevates the cafe beyond your typical coffee stop.
While the artwork adorning the walls and ceilings might be described as simple, its execution and placement are anything but. It's clear a thoughtful hand has curated the decor, achieving a sense of visual harmony that is both calming and aesthetically pleasing. The lighting further enhances this carefully crafted ambiance, creating a warm and inviting glow throughout the cafe.
The attention to detail extends to the furniture. The variety of seating options is a testament to the owner's understanding of different customer needs and preferences. Crucially, all the furniture I observed appeared to be of high quality, adding to the overall impression of a well-considered and upscale establishment. It's evident that the owner has invested significant effort in creating a unique and appealing environment, setting Elio Cafe apart from the competition.
Although I didn't sample the array of snacks and desserts on offer during this visit, a quick glance at the neighbouring tables was enough to impress. The cakes and pastries looked tempting and clearly well-received, suggesting a high standard of quality in their culinary offerings.
My focus on this occasion was the coffee, and I opted for an Americano with milk. I was not disappointed. The coffee was genuinely excellent, possessing a distinct and memorable flavour profile. It had a unique character that hinted at a blend  I hadn't encountered before, leaving a lasting positive impression.
Beyond the impressive aesthetics and quality coffee, the staff at Elio Cafe truly contribute to the positive experience. Their friendly and courteous demeanour made my visit even more enjoyable. Their attentiveness and welcoming attitude added a layer of warmth to the already pleasant atmosphere.
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Elio Cafe to anyone venturing into the Mailbox or even the wider Birmingham City Centre area. It's more than just a place to grab a coffee; it's an experience. The combination of elegant design, a thoughtfully curated ambiance, excellent coffee, and friendly service makes it well worth a visit.

Turns out they want you to collect the coffee.

Independent shops need all the business they can get, so I would imagine you would want to give extra food service given the competition and price but no, it reminds me of KFC, not a premium coffee shop.

It might seem like a small thing but it’s enough to turn off your customers and as someone who frequents coffee shops a lot, this one get a big 1 star from me.

We tried to book a table but the email received to our request was non- committal to this and when I arrived, the server knew nothing of our booking. There was a table however and liked the vibe and look of the place. First the food, between the three of us we went for a desi breakfast, Shakshuka, halloumi hash and shared a loaded cheese fries (originally went for the loaded nachos but out of stock) All the food absolutely delicious and would return to try more dishes as really good selection of veggie food. However the disappointment was the chai! After discussion with the server of options, I ordered what I thought was going to be a pumpkin spice chai latte. Unfortunately when it arrived, it contained coffee which I absolutely can't stand or stomach!! I returned it and the server apologised and I was given a second drink. Despite my adding several sugars, this was completely undrinkable as very powdery and bitter. My third attempt at a drink was a standard masala chai, which I took away with me but to be honest, it was on par with the masala chai teabags I use at home. Food great and if you are not a coffee phobic like me, you will probably like the drinks but unfortunately I was disappointed with the chai drinks, which I had been looking forward to trying.",2024-10-25 08:34:03,en

Nice options for coffee. Sitting available both inside and outside, with tables for 2 or more. There is a weird plantation inside, acting as a divider between the continuous sofa type sitting, but is a huge waste of space. Interior designing mistake?
The popular item here is ""White chocolate matcha"", you can get it in hot and cold (iced) versions. A kind of attraction of this place, as everyone can be seen a cup with green liquid. Worth it! Most of the drinks are available in small and large cup options.
It says skip the queue, order using App, we tried but the app wasn't working to take orders. Though you can scroll the menu in the app while in the queue, so installing it was not a total waste.

The only gripe is the fried chicken from one plate to another varied quite a bit in size. We don’t know whether one was more generous, or we were short changed on the other? A bit of consistency here wouldn’t go amiss.

The food is excellent. Well priced. Generous portions and overall delicious.

From street level up the stairs you are greeted with a take away counter for loads of baked treat and bread which look and smell amazing.

You then have a small hallway with bench seating where the coffee are made which did get a little congested as it’s so popular. We did book which I thoroughly recommend to not have to wait for a table.

The dining room is large. Bright and airy with high ceilings, loads of green succulents and gallery walls.  Current exhibition is a photography collection of black culture in the UK. Lots of bench style seating down the middle which means you may share the bench with others (something which never bothers me)

The service speed is what lets the venue down. The coffee is excellent but always takes a long time to come. This has been a consistent issue with all my visits. The food is delicious.

Medicine is by far my favourite place for brunch in birmingham, the food is gorgeous and made with high quality ingredients. Presented beautifully and with really well-balanced flavours.

The location itself is wonderful, going through a hole in the wall in the murky town centre is a bright sun-light filled room with art and greenery. A super welcoming change to the streets.

The coffee is okay- not fantastic but the sweet treats are fabulous as to be expected. Definitely a spot worth hitting up if you’re in birmingham. Truly a gem in the rough. Service can be quite slow and inconsistent but it’s understandably very popular and busy during weekend lunchtimes. The food definitely is worth the wait and the fair prices.

I pulled apart the portion. I don’t think there was 2-3 oz of actual fish. This was cod apparently. However the meagre amount that was there was an odd shade of grey where cod is a white fish.
I have no idea what that green stuff was accompanying the fish. It certainly wasn’t mushy peas. A grainy paste like reconstituted portion of garbage with literally no flavour. The chips were as you would expect - catering level.

Only one security guy ruined the end of the night for us for shouting  at my boyfriends face “ because he is too tired” and he got a reaction.

Shouldn’t be shouting at clients that were enjoying the whole night without causing trouble , just because you had a long day at work.

I work as a bartender in a very busy nightclub and I have never shouted at one last costumer  ( especially knowing they been having  drinks) for wanting more drinks even when we’re closing down , I stay calm and still politely tell them it’s closed , I don’t start shouting “GO HOME” at them because I had a long shift.

Hopefully he works on that so clients don’t react that way anymore. Rest of the security were helpful and respectful to my boyfriend.

During my last visit, a barmaid was particularly unpleasant: she spoke in a curt and impolite manner, without taking the time to listen to customers or respond properly to their requests. We clearly felt like we were intruding, as if we were a nuisance. This lack of respect and professionalism seriously detracts from the atmosphere of the bar. It's a real shame, because the place itself has potential. I hope this can be taken into account to improve the welcome in the future.

As for snacks - it's not exactly snacks galore but there are those amazing uglies chocs, biscuits in a packet, soft drinks (pepsi, lemonade, tomato juice and water) and a coffee machine. There's also a selection teas (mint/green/earl grey/eng breakfast/etc.).

I mean it could be slightly better if I am honest but if you have the right ticket you can avoid the temptations of spending more money in the station or getting on with work.

Location is a bit of a pain if you are due to travel from platforms 6 upward as you have to go out of the ticket barrier and in through another one.

As I feel it ruins the experience as the music there is often a vibe for the younger ear, so it's not a bad place just needs a few improvements.

Oh, the roof keepings leaking as well and some of the sticks are missing the pads from the top or there weighs but other than that, it's okay could be much better,  would I recommend No- will I still frequent possibly. So refub needed I feel, as the seating and painting on the walls were nice additions but the roof, tables and sticks there need to be upgraded with brand new ones asap. The staff are all pleasant and well mannered, so it's only being let down by the quality of the items there.

Lastly, the placement of the tables are  too close together so there are times where I've been bumped into mid aim of my turn which has resulted in me missing my shot or giving 2 goes away, cause the neighbouring table are way less than a pool stick away,  so maybe remove the top 2 tables and organise the space better.",2025-06-27 20:01:24,en

We were extremely disappointed, especially as we had specifically booked to play pool. The tables and cues were, at best, poor quality. This is a venue with zero love or care invested in it. They’re clearly busy enough to overlook maintenance, and it shows.

When we picked up our cues from reception, they were in a tattered and shabby state. As we set up, we noticed there was no triangle on our table. After asking a staff member, I was told to “borrow one from another table,” as though it were normal to lack such basic equipment. Shocked, I asked if each table had its own triangle and was told, surprisingly casually, that they did not.

Imagine a pool club with battered tables, worn-out cues, and no basic equipment at each table, requiring players to interrupt others mid-game to borrow what they need.

Lovely heartwarming dishes with great flavour, the taste was so fresh, really lovely.
The only thing I would say is that the atmosphere was strange, there was no music, we were one of 5 tables in a small place but it was so quiet and as people left we felt so awkward just having a conversation. Even with 5 tables there was no buzzing chit chat it just felt so cold and hostile, which is such a shame for a place with good food in a stunning location.
There were great vegan options available which was also a win!

Other important notes, this place does not accept cash/coin payments, only via card. So if you’re a O.G who would like to pay by cash/coins, I would not recommend this cafe to you. Also to note this place is not a dog free place (unfortunately). So if you were to value hygiene above all else this place is not for you.

So as a person who is a sceptic of dog culture in general I would not see myself coming back to this coffee shop.

Nothing to indicate we were doing anything wrong. Then out of nowhere, a third server comes by, completely rude and hostile from the moment she opened her mouth. She didn’t even face us properly, just barked at us with a nasty tone asking if we had bought anything. When we said yes, she snapped that we “can’t just sit down there all day” and told us we needed to move upstairs because they can’t see us down there. Then she stormed off like we had personally offended her. Her attitude was aggressive, condescending, and completely unnecessary. We had never even interacted with her before, yet she acted like we were causing a problem when we were literally just sitting quietly with our drinks.

I was with my partner and saw the A board which promoted the £3.50 meal deal. The time was about 13.00pm.
We just about found the place on Cannon Street. It looked derelict from the outside.
We managed to go upstairs. 0 marks for accessibility. Anyone with mobility issues, in a wheelchair or with pushchairs won't be able to access the space, which is up narrow stairs into a large seated area.
The decor might try to give off New York style loft vibes. But it looked dated and dimly lit, cold and dirty like a run down warehouse.
The venue was empty. One person was behind the counter.
I enquired about the meal deal, to be told they were ""sold out"". I thought it's lunchtime, we're diabetic and we needed a quick bite. But if this is sold out, for a practically new eaterie, they need to do better. It's not like the venue was busy or full. There was no-one there and the offer of a meal deal ""sold out"" speaks volumes.

This is not a good start to a new business venture and I can't see it lasting more than 12 months.",2025-03-31 11:09:08,en

Burger was excellent, really enjoyed it. Fries were meh, but filled a hole.

Massive shout-out to Bhush. Fantastic service, great banter and a sense of humour too. He made the experience better on all levels.

Yet another venue where they ask for a service charge (tip) before food arrives. What if it's terrible? I just don't like this concept. I paid it in advance, on the back of Bhush being great. Luckily the doors was also good, but I just don't like the concept.",2025-05-31 23:34:19,en

I challenge you to find a pint of beer of this quality at this price anywhere else in the city all day Monday to Friday

Update: I have revisited after a couple of months (which included wallet busting increases for hospitality employers such as minimum wage increasing and increases on NI plus costs of products reaching all time price highs) and what do I find when i arrive here? The price of a pint has come down by 35p on my aforementioned review.

Still giving the same amazing friendly service and now at £3.40 for a pint in the city centre while all others are starting to increase prices, makes this place a must visit.

Once inside our gaming booth, the immersion was next level. It genuinely felt like we had stepped into a different world, battling zombies side by side. The experience was intense, interactive, and so much fun!

To top it all off, at the end of the session, they send fun video highlights of your gameplay straight to your email, which was such a great touch. Both my wife and I loved every second of it and immediately agreed we’d be back for more.

Our meals came quickly even though it was utter mayhem with the amount of people.  Staff looked tired and fed up,  no smiles just blunt comments with serious faces. I understand that they must be worked off their feet and it was so hot, so i don't blame them for being low in energy. Especially if they are at the end of their shifts.
We were halfway through our meal and still had no drinks,  we were told there was 25 minute wait but we had already been waiting half hour.  It was a really hot evening and we were parched so I asked a passing lad who worked there about them,  he went and got them for us.  Shortly after necking our sodas, we needed another but the bar was 3 layers thick with people waiting.  It took us another 25 minutes to finally get served,  there was no order to the serving and we were walked by several times,  and other people who hadn't waited as long as us got served.
Then suddenly,  a bar fairy full of smiles,  bounding energy and gorgeous floaty sleeves fluttered into the bar,  zooming around making polite happy comments to customers and cleared up the back log in a mere 10 minutes. Whoever she was,  she was absolutely fantastic! Shortly after in the bathroom she was flitting around filling up the toilet rolls as every stall was empty in the ladies!

The environment was buzzing.
- Hospitality was 10/10.
- Staff who served us were accommodating.
I don’t know if it was the owner who looked after us but he did a great job taking care of us when we did bowling and karaoke. We had a few good laughs with him too (‘fish’).
100% would recommend to family and friends!!
We will definitely be back to try out the activities we didn’t have time for.

Thank you!!

One member of our group is a wheelchair user, and after reading the helpful guidance on the theatre’s website, I booked aisle seats as advised. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel incredibly welcome. At the main entrance, we were greeted by Pete—proudly nicknamed “Batman” on his badge—which instantly brought a smile to our faces. Pete went out of his way to assist us, even radioing ahead for support. When staff were momentarily tied up, he personally escorted us to the accessible entrance around the corner.

There, we were met by Ollie, who couldn't have been more helpful. He guided us to our seats and ensured the wheelchair was parked in a safe and convenient location, tucked out of the way but easily reachable.

After the show, Ollie discreetly kept an eye on us and returned the wheelchair when we were ready to leave, making our exit smooth and stress-free.

The service we received was genuinely above and beyond. Both Pete and Ollie were kind, proactive, and a credit to the theatre. We’ll absolutely be returning—and crossing our fingers that they're working that day!",2025-07-14 20:46:58,en

Working for this agency turned out to be the worse experience I have had in my entire life. It was traumatising and emotionally scaring. These are such disgraceful people to work for , as you are always disposable to them ,never theirs to look after . Stay away from their job assignments unless totally desperate for work. To give this a little context,  long story short, I`ve been employed by this company on a 6 months contract initially and then extended with claps and good feedbacks from those above, until 31st March 2025. Not long after the contract has been extended by Brook street client, due to funds being cut down their client no longer needed Brook Street agency workers. The client told me so straight forward no hidden agendas at the time and of course I insisted that the contract is honoured until the 31st of Match 2025 as agreed. Immediately after around Christmas period, they ( I refer to they as the company who hired me through brook street) started treating me bad and most of the time cold and ignorant towards me in an attempt to either find a reason to terminate my contract before term or to make me leave due to their awful treatment and so the fund cuts are met. I was constantly told that if I don`t like something or I have an issue to call the agency as I am not their problem. They where  constantly finding me faults I didn`t have before and most days I was given no work at all and then hoovered over and bubbled behind for `` being useless`` and not doing any work. I mention that work is distributed or assigned by a manager we didn`t just get in and pic whatever to do. I raised the (no work while some are overwhelmed with too much work to do) issue with one of the managers asking for work as other colleagues of mine were clearly overwhelmed, I was always offering to help others  in my team , but then again I was told to call the agency if I don't like it as I am not their problem. There was no kind communication from this employer anymore. After about 2-3 months of this sort of treatment and threats that if I complain it won`t be well  , they finally somehow found me to be in ``conflict of interest with them`` for a job I was planning to undertake after ending the assortment with them and when that did not work they pinned me down for other bits and bobs and and finally ended my contract on the day I wasn`t even there preventing me from collecting my belongings in a decent way anyone would expect to . I was refused entry to collect my belongings after 12 months there, out of the blue I was treated like a criminal. I never knew what working for a agency feels like , not being a direct employee to a company makes you their door mat ,this is modern slavery as agency workers most of the time are treated bad and not equal as initially presented so you accept the job. Agency workers remain in job after figuring out the details to respect their contracts or pay the bloody bills but for me this is a never again .

Update 20.03.2025  : Spoke with Louise at Brook street and I was told that unfortunately this is the way agency assignments end with notice but also without notice at all. If you get unlucky and your assignment ends, without notice on a day you are not at work, you get disrespected and treated like a criminal and whatever you had on the desk or drawers etc goes at the front door so you can get further disrespected when you go to collect them. Basically you get binned like you were nothing , and that is standard procedure of ending assignments with Brook Street.

Update 21.03.2025 : Went to pick up the box with my belongings that they decided to return to me to find in the box someone else's stuff , a pen of mine , a cup and a cardigan. The rest can be of use to them I suppose, that is straight thieves. That is not only disrespectful and disgraceful but it is an abuse. My personal belongings should've never been touched by anyone but me.",2025-03-21 10:14:02,en

She did pick out some lovely dresses for me with one still popping jntj my head when shopping later in the day which I never even looked at when I first arrived on the concession.
Tried them on in the main store instead of in selfridges as I first went round all the shops in Bullrjng to see which options on dresses I had before trying any on.
Sadly the one dress I thought would be the best colour for me (which it was) they didn't have my size available in the store for me to try on. They did get me the same style of dress in the right size but in a different colour to try on and if it was right they offered to offer it for me in the store that day. Sadly I did need the dress in the right colour to try on as the other colour I tried just didn't look right so I couldn't get the best option from trying that on.
Will try to come back when I'm working in town next week to order the dress, both the team members that helped me on the concession and in the store where amazing and very helpful when I was looking around.

The coffee was mediocre,  while the muffin I bought had all the characteristics of having been made at the same time as the tea rooms.
Prices are high in the tea rooms (£7.35 for substandard coffee and cake), while items for sale in the museum shop are also priced to appeal to those with higher levels of disposable income. (It's not a given that everyone who enjoys art and history also enjoys over-paying for everything...)
Aiming high with prices is fine if quality and value match the price point. I don't think it does here - call me picky, but discerning also fits...

I was genuinely shocked by the level of mismanagement and unprofessionalism I experienced at the Apple Store in Birmingham especially given the reputation of the brand.

A friend of mine had previously purchased an Apple phone case from this location. Although it was significantly more expensive than similar products sold elsewhere, the sales representative assured us it came with a one-year warranty, which gave us peace of mind at the time.

However, upon returning to the store to make a claim, we were informed that the warranty does not cover regular cases unless there is an issue with MagSafe or physical components like buttons. Fair enough warranty terms are what they are. But our concern was not solely about the warranty itself; it was the clear misinformation provided by the original staff member during purchase.

When we raised this with the person who identified herself as the store manager, she curtly advised us to “take it to the ombudsman” without properly listening to our concerns. Despite our repeated attempts to explain that we simply wished to file a complaint regarding the misleading sales information, she interrupted us several times and dismissed our request without giving it even a minute's consideration.

She later emailed us a generic message reiterating that the warranty doesn’t apply, without addressing the original point—namely, the false information provided at the time of purchase. When we asked again about the complaint process, she told us she would return shortly, but disappeared for over 15 minutes. We remained in the store waiting patiently, only to be told by other staff members that they were “busy” and we should continue waiting.

For a brand of Apple’s standing, this was a deeply disappointing experience. I strongly urge Apple to establish clear complaint-handling procedures within its retail stores and ensure staff are trained to respectfully acknowledge customer concerns even when a resolution isn’t possible. Ignoring people and simply deflecting them to external bodies like the ombudsman is not acceptable for a premium retail environment.",2025-07-19 18:46:13,en

The first problem was that they have AMPR barriers at the entrance an exit so the system wouldn't recognise my bike as ot only has a rear registration plate. Had to phone an operator at the ticket machine and they let me through and said that parking would still be free.

I've finally entered and done 3 laps of the first floor and 1 lap of every pther available floor to try and find these designated parking spaces for motorcycles, and came up short as there are no spaces solely for them. There were designated disability spaces and electric charging points, but nothing for motorcycles.

I rang the operator again to ask where these spaces where and he just told me that I should just park somewhere sensible and I should be alright. I chose an empty space on the first floor trying to follow what they originally claimed on the website.

Upon my exit I had the same problem of the ANPR system not recognising my motorcycle and had to phone an operator again to be let out.

Don't get me wrong the car park is well maintained, has good sized spaces for cars and has CCTV everywhere in the facility, but they need to update their ANPR system and actually add some motorcycle parking bays because without those features parking on with a bike is more trouble than it's worth.",2025-05-11 06:05:38,en

I recently visited Merlin's Cafe Bar and, unfortunately, it was a bit of a mixed experience. Despite the place being nearly empty, the food took a surprisingly long time to arrive, which was disappointing. When it finally did, it was no better than average—nothing particularly memorable.

On a more positive note, the service was friendly and attentive, which was a real saving grace. The staff do their best, but it’s a shame they aren’t backed up by the quality or efficiency of the food.

The decor is definitely a highlight. It’s well done and provides plenty to look at while you wait—something that came in handy given the delays.

Overall, Merlin’s has some potential, but the food needs to step up to match the good service and appealing atmosphere.",2024-12-15 17:28:38,en

My partner got the All day breakfast which has amazing fresh sausages, I got myself a chicken burger with American style thick cut bacon and my god, it has to be the best chicken burger I’ve ever eaten in my life. You know in ads where you see someone bite into a burger and it gets a crunch? this had it, I’ve never experienced anything like that before. The chips were amazing too reminding me of my the chips my Nan used to cook which sent me into a flashback just like in ratatouille where it sent me to being a kid again they was lovely and very well cooked. We also got a portion of macaroni and cheese croquettes which we’ve had in other places before and have let us down so was worried but after the first bite that worry was gone. The food was all fresh & you could taste it.

We got both a homemade cake which was beautiful too. The service was amazing the owner came over spoke to us about his journey, music & more.

I could write a story but in short:

Negatives;
- The drinks are over priced, for reference a small wkd is like £4/5 ish and £1 more than in sidewalk which is 100 feet away.
- The vast majority of staff just sort of stand around killing time not looking at the bar
- They don't cut people off so there's the odd mega drunk walking around
- Seating wise you don't have much of an option unless it's outside or a small area completely out of view from the stage/dance area
- The upstairs smoking area looks like a back alley
- In terms of cleanliness the toilets are cleaner than some area

Positives so far:
- They have really good drag acts
- The bouncers that I've talked to are friendly
- A few of the staff don't hate their job

Overall and this is coming from someone brand new to the gay scene and 30, missing is the type of bar where you either go out as a group of like 4 or more and dance or get absolutely wasted, if you don't fit in to that category you're going to have a meh time.

It's the type of pub where you start your night off and go alright I've had a drink here let's go to sidewalk or eden",2025-05-04 04:58:02,en

The food is average to good, however, some dishes are quite expensive for what you get in terms of portion size.
It's a posh place and that's what you're paying for; the location, decor and ambience.
Last visit was with a reservation and the place was absolutely packed. The customer service at the entryway was polite, and we were seated immediately.
Once ordered, the food arrived quickly and all was good with that. As we finished off drinks and the table was being cleared, the manager asked us to leave because there were people waiting. However, it was us that were waiting for dessert, which was taking a long time to arrive as they forgot about it. The waiter/manager/guy in suit did apologise for rushing us.
Slightly disappointed with the forgetful service, but it happens when you're rushed off your feet and not all staff are ""on the same page"".",2025-03-16 18:35:43,en

Let’s start with the host. A very tall Black gentleman (only mentioning for identification, as he wore no name tag) was at the entrance. He walked right up to us, saw us waiting, and didn’t even bother to say hello. It wasn’t until I stared directly at him for a while that he finally mumbled a “hello,” as if I had to beg just to be acknowledged. Basic hospitality? Nonexistent.

We were then refused seating in a clearly open section of the restaurant — lights on, people dining, and absolutely no “reserved” signage. When asked why we couldn’t sit there, the answer was vague and dismissive. Instead, we were led to a cramped, uncomfortable spot. The entire interaction felt cold and unwelcoming.

As for the food? Laughably small portions — honestly, I wouldn’t serve this to a dog. At this price point, I expected at least something decent, but the flavors were average at best. You’re paying premium rates for barely edible, forgettable dishes.

Cold service, inflated prices, microscopic portions, and a general attitude that makes you feel like you’re the inconvenience — Fumo is a hard pass. Never returning, and I’d strongly advise others to steer clear",2025-04-09 19:10:15,en

The food was flavourful and well-presented, though it did take a bit of time to arrive. Prices were a little on the higher side for a casual meal, but the quality of the food made up for it.

For starters, my wife and I shared the chicken mango salad and duck dumplings. Both dishes were fresh, full of flavour, and nicely balanced — a great way to start the meal. The kids were happy with their chicken mains served with chips and salad — simple but tasty and well portioned.

For mains, I went for the Bun-Cha-Ha-Noi, which included fresh rice noodles, thinly sliced pork, king prawn meatballs, and a traditional spring roll. It was a delicious combination of textures and flavours. My wife had the grilled lemongrass chilli chicken — flame-grilled thighs marinated in a fragrant chilli blend — and she really enjoyed the spicy kick.

Another great spot is Sakura — I ordered the bento box, and the portion was huge! You really get your money’s worth, and it left me feeling full and happy. 🍱

On the flip side, the Korean food stall didn’t quite meet expectations. The wait was much longer compared to the others, and when the food finally arrived, it was quite bland. The portion was also pretty small, which was disappointing. 😕

There is nothing premier about this accommodation.

Little things in here just didn’t make sense, an apartment that sleeps 4, yet the kettle only holds enough water to make 2 cups of teas/coffee and a toaster that makes 2 slices of toast, also there was only 1 sofa that has enough room for 2 people, the room was big enough to fit another, its little things like this that made our stay not as good as it could have been.

We Booked a 2 bed apartment for 4 of us, one of us had a bath, then we ran out of hot water and after an hour still no hot water.
We called the emergency number and to be fair they sorted us out 2, 1 bed apartments and said we could keep all of them if we just wanted to use to shower, we think the apartment the hot water ran out of the boiler was on a timer, except it was in a locked cupboard, the other apartments, you had access to this.
The 2nd apartment we were in the fuse ring that all the plug sockets and the boiler was on tripped our last morning and wouldn’t go back, so no hot water or plugs so had to back to the old apartment for this.
The first apartment the rooms didn’t smell very clean and the 2nd apartment we were in stunk of cigarettes, the rooms are clean, just not very well maintained.

Horrible, horrible, horrible! This is by far the worst place I have ever stayed in my life. The staff were shockingly unfriendly—completely lacking basic manners or any sense of customer service.

My room was boiling hot, and when I asked the receptionist if I could move to a cooler room, she didn’t even bother to check the system. She just said, “All rooms are fully booked,” with an attitude like she owns the entire Travelodge. No apology, no effort, nothing.

I felt dismissed, disrespected, and completely let down. I’ve stayed in budget hotels before, but this was something else—zero professionalism, zero empathy. I honestly wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone.

As we were attending a concert that evening we arrived to check in at 11:30pm, only to be told that our room was no longer available, allegedly due to a flood.. Whilst this excuse was questionable, we were offered an alternate Travelodge 30 minutes away. We agreed to stay there, as we had no other choice, and the man on the desk said he would call a taxi to take us there. 40 minutes later, there was no sign of a taxi and when asking where the taxi is, the man on the desk said he hadn't ordered it. There were also two security men in reception that evening who were incredibly rude when asking if we could use a bathroom whilst waiting.

We decided to make our own way home as nothing was being done to arrange an alternative room.

When dealing with customer services, we were given a refund on the room, but nothing else in terms of compensation. This is incredibly disappointing as we had to pay to get home. (We had no confidence there would even be another room at the other Travelodge).

We were not told prior that our room was no longer available. My suspicion would be they gave our room to someone else for a hire rate as we'd not checked in earlier. If there was a flood, surely we would have been contacted..

I would avoid this Travelodge, but also the wider group as the customer service has been terrible.",2025-07-16 09:46:21,en

This hotel was a complete disappointment. Cleanliness was clearly not a priority. My room had a filthy carpet that seemed like it had never been cleaned. The furniture was extremely old and in bad shape, so much so that I didn’t even want to touch anything. The bedding looked decades old and worn out.

The bathroom wasn’t any better: a cheap, ugly shower curtain, low-quality toiletries, and an overall unclean feel. The entire hotel had an odd, unpleasant smell throughout.

Breakfast was disaster. Dirty cutlery, very old dishes, and extremely poor food quality. I stuck to only pre-packaged items out of concern. The coffee tasted awful, definitely the lowest quality possible.

As for the location, it might be close to the city center with train/bus stations being in walking distance, but the neighborhood is far from welcoming. I felt unsafe just walking outside the hotel. The area was dirty and made me uncomfortable.

I absolutely do not recommend this hotel to anyone. It was an unpleasant experience from start to finish.",2025-05-03 15:59:38,en

After purchasing a top and a bag at the self-checkout, I noticed a label on the bag that said something like “secure tagged.” I approached a staff member near the self-checkout area and politely asked if the item still had a tag, as I didn’t want the alarm to go off when leaving the store.

Rather than checking or offering assistance, she responded in a rude manner, telling me to get in the queue. The queue was very long, with only one staff member serving many customers, most of whom were making returns, so it took a long time for me to be seen.

Eventually, when I reached the till, I was asked to step aside while a male colleague was radioed. He brought me back to the self-checkout, scanned the item, and confirmed there was no tag on it. He apologized for the experience, but by that point, I had only a few minutes left to get to work.

I had made my purchase with plenty of time to spare, but the lack of assistance and the dismissive attitude of the initial staff member caused a significant and unnecessary delay. I found her unwillingness to help extremely frustrating and unprofessional.

I am very disappointed by the service I received and hope this feedback will be used to improve the customer experience at this store.",2025-05-07 11:38:19,en

This felt misleading; it is unfair to tell customers they can receive a phone plan when there is still a credit history check involved.

I had already mentioned that I am new to the country and have no direct debits in my name. Despite this, they insisted that I take the SIM plan, which is quite expensive compared to other companies. For instance, I bought a plan for my wife from EE for just £13 per month, while I am paying £22 per month and still do not have a phone plan.

The staff member there told me to try again after another three months, which further reinforces how misleading the initial information was. I was excited about getting a phone plan after three months, and my wife and I even chose the phone’s storage and color. In the end, however, my credit history was declined, leaving me without a phone plan.

I need this issue to be addressed as soon as possible. I was hopeful about obtaining the phone plan, and now I feel frustrated. If this situation cannot be resolved, I would like to port my plan to EE.",2025-07-07 09:31:11,en

Usually when I go to the makeup stands, I cannot try the products I want to as there are no testers available, and there are also only a few products available to buy. Often a few shelves are fully empty.
The queue time is also often very long, and there are often not many staff on the till, considering it is a busy shop. I have actually known the queue to get very long, but there still be no staff at all at the till point. (See photo for part of a queue on such an occasion).
It may seem strange that this largely negative review is attached to a 3-star review, however I must give credit to the lovely team members at the store, to the pharmacy staff for always being so helpful, for the well stocked pharmacy shelves and to the people who have given me vaccinations at the store in the past.

Unacceptable! I understand it's hard to work in retail, and it's a very hot day with a lot people but the staff single handedly turned what was a misunderstanding situation into a escalated conflicts! As customer, I feel misjudged and discriminate and I don't feel valued or looked after. So I tried to ask for help as I shop for products but not only the female staff was ignoring me cuz she was speaking with the security by the door, but she was also not helpful at all, I picked up a bundle box at ordinary display but the products display was misplaced and it was not actually whats inside the box behind it and i was super confused and all three boxs of the ordinary bundle were worn out and shows signs of been opened by someone and as i was inspecting and called her over for help, the staff she immediately came over and accused me of opening the box but I didnt even open it fully i was just checking if its the right content cuz all the bundle box has been already opened by someone and I was just checking cuz I was buying it! and after I pointed out it's looks abit worn and the product placement was confusing she then handed me another box but it was extremely worn out box with yellow stains on it, it's giving the impression she was trying to sell me inferior products and i bet she wouldn't even buy it herself seen that, and i said no and she immediately started pulling off that attitude as if I have to buy that (the products thats opened by other people already) and she didnt even help me to get the product I wanted ! And I told her what I actually wanted and she was like oh its somewhere else and the other staff came and handed me that and then the female staff immediately talked to the other staff right in front of me: ""you see, this is what I meant"" while both pulling off that stinky attitude and clearly referred to the situation, i felt extremely offended and that just straight up unprofessional and rude and unnecessary to do this in front of customers!, isn't helping customers the job ???! All of that is so unnecessary and even if I shouldn't open it to check (in that case I totally should) the way she didnt even listen and think about what on about she just decides to take piss on me.

For mains, my wife chose the 3-cheese pizza, which was indulgent and packed with flavor, while I went for the rotisserie chicken in a spicy honey sauce. The chicken was juicy, tender, and had just the right balance of sweetness and heat.

I appreciated being given the option to choose my steak’s temperature, a detail that speaks well of the restaurant’s commitment to quality. I went for medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection. Although a fillet can sometimes be a bit tough, this one was mostly tender and exceptionally juicy. The dish came with a side of skinny fries that were perfectly crispy on the outside and delightfully fluffy on the inside.

From the moment we were seated, Carl made us feel welcomed and at ease. His warm, genuine attitude stood out immediately — attentive without being overbearing, and always one step ahead of our needs.

He knew the menu inside out and gave great recommendations that turned out to be spot-on. What really impressed us was his timing and attention to detail — drinks were refilled before we had to ask, and the courses arrived at a perfect pace. Even when the restaurant got busy, Carl remained calm, friendly, and completely professional.

It’s rare to find someone who clearly takes pride in their work like Carl does. He helped make the night feel more special, and we’ll definitely be coming back — largely because of the excellent experience he provided.

Highly recommend asking for Carl if you’re dining here. A true credit to the team.",2025-07-03 17:53:19,en

First impression count and he got off to great start. I called the following morning and spoke to Miriam....what can I say a credit to your brand and your Selly Oak store. I had difficult in making payment as my company block the sum up site :(
This was not a problem Miriam was excellent. Going beyond customer expectations in finding a solution. Payment made pizzas ordered and delivered on time to the QE hospital. My customers hoovered up all 13 pizzas in a heartbeat. On a final note the delivery drivers are also a credit to the Selly Oak team.  I received a generous discount brining my bill down to a very acceptable price £150

We were looking for somewhere to break our fast (iftar) and we decided to go here
We were 20 mins late to our booking due to the traffic in the city centre so I called and the person that answered just put the phone down, if it wasn’t Iftar time we would’ve gone elsewhere but due to how busy it would be everywhere else we decided to still go there
I called back and said we were 7 mins away and the time to break fast was 2 mins ago can I place my order via the phone so we can have it as soon as we get there but the person that took my call said no and put the phone down.. rude

We got there ordered our food and waited around half an hour.. do not get the mixed platter for 2 it’s a scam and so over priced for what you get.. but this is what the waiter pushed us to get
You’re better off getting two individual meals and the portions are a lot better and better value for money, the saffron rice was disappointing and was the only reason I wanted to go back.. was really bland
We noticed we were treated a lot different to the other customers as we were the only brown/muslim couple there and other tables were offered complimentary olives and sides etc.. where was ours? We got given little chunks of dried cookies to break our fast

It is unusual for me to forget a place, and that I couldn't see my review.
I guess it is my age.
Anyway it was some rather nice adverts on FB that made me want to visit last Saturday night. However I did notice that it had received mixed reviews but these never put me off a place. Most reviews don't tell you a fat lot anyway.
Parking isn't great in Harborne but we struck lucky with a space on a nearby side street. It's situated on the first floor, up a long flight and I didn't notice any provision for those with mobility issues.
Once inside it has a very nice feel, although the trip to the loo let's the side down. The wife wasn't a big fan of the unisex cubicles.
It's licenced and the bar is well stocked however you can take your own alcohol but they will add a corkage fee which I think is a £1 per person.
It was quite busy and the atmosphere was very pleasant, relaxed and somewhat respectful which makes a change. The service was pleasant, quite a few staff but some were more engaging than others.
The food was excellent, and I couldn't find fault. I noticed some reviews mentioned bland but our starter and both mains were just the opposite.
The shared sheekh kebab was very nice, it could have done with a few more seconds in the microwave but it was very tasty and quite large.
The chicken Chetinad and a chicken curry were hard to tell apart until you tasted them. The Chetinad although a 'thinner' curry than I would prefer had layered spicing more typical of Indian style cooking than Bangladeshi.
The sides were excellent, especially the naan. None of that tricolour pilau rice either. The chips were good, could be better but I would say that for all but one 'Indian' restaurant in the Midlands.
I thought the bill was surprisingly good taking everything into consideration and I would be more than happy to go back.",2025-05-30 21:35:21,en

The pizza arrived hot and fresh, with that signature soft, chewy crust and a generous layer of cheese. I went with the classic Pepperoni and added some extra mushrooms—flavors were solid and the toppings were nicely distributed.

The garlic dip is still one of the best parts of the meal—creamy, rich, and perfect for crust-dipping. The sides (cheesy garlic breadsticks and chicken poppers) were decent, though a little greasy.

Delivery was on time, packaging was secure, and everything was still warm when it arrived. Prices are a bit higher compared to some other chains, but the quality generally matches up.

My partner is Gluten Free, and Harborne Kitchen went out of their way to accommodate that dietary requirement.

We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we stepped in. We were greeted by all the staff and even the chefs all said allow as we walked by the pass to our seat.

We both went for the tasting menu. And I had the wine pairing. The food was exceptional. Beautifully presented, and each plate was introduced to us by one of the chefs. There are one or two reviews on here complaining about portion size. I think the problem here is common with a taster menu. Especially the Malloreddus. That dish was so good. I wanted to get a big big bowl of it, change into my fat pants, sit on my sofa, and scoff the lot. We were both waddling out of the restaurant after, so there are no complaints from us about portion size.

My only criticism is the tomato course, which is literally a slice of tomato with a couple of onions chucked on. Served with a little bit of stock. I can't understand why it is on a taster menu at a fine dining restaurant.

The decor was nice. The atmosphere was very pleasant. Good vibes all round. And we appreciated the birthday wishes with a chocolate treat. Thank you, Harborne Kitchen. We will definitely be back soon 😋",2024-10-13 14:39:12,en

We went there during the week so it was rather quiet, which we actually prefer. The restaurant has a nice bar in the front of the house, where you can enjoy a range of interesting and imaginative cocktails, but they serve classics too. The restaurant part is at the back and you pass an open plan kitchen with bar seats as well, where you can see all the master preparation, it's really interesting! There are normal tables as well obviously, further back.
We had a tasting menu with wine pairing. I really enjoyed the finger food that comes before the main menu, but all dishes were great. Some interesting matches, but also some surprisingly simple dishes like a pasta with butter, truffle and cheese, were absolutely delicious, and nicely paired with the wine. You can taste the quality of ingredients, and masterful preparation just completes the dish. The service is impeccable, friendly and knowledgeable. The sommelier was particularly good, clearly knowing his trade, but also very approachable and nice to talk to.
The whole menu comes to about 8 or 9 dishes, so it's a lot, and we struggled a bit to finish it all!

The fish was perfectly cooked, really meaty and moist. The dish wasn’t too spicy even though there were lots of chillis in the sauce but I experienced a delightful numbing sensation on my lips which I was informed by my fellow diner was from the peppercorns. These two dishes were all we ordered between us (approx £8 each) but each came with a side of stir fried vegetables, fluffy white rice and a tomato and chicken soup. It was a feast! We were told if we ran out of these sides we could ask for more. I was tempted to, but I was too full! I really recommend this café and I will certainly like to return to try the other dishes.

We started with the seafood platter, which overall was decent. The sauces were the highlight and added a lot of flavour, but the shrimp was slightly overcooked and the scallops were a bit rubbery. Still, the sauces made up for it.

For the main, I went for the hot platter, which was quite underwhelming. There was barely any beef - mostly just a lot of vegetables. It was very spicy, which I don’t mind, but the overall flavour was just average. Honestly, your local Chinese takeaway could serve up more flavour. The rice was also just plain and nothing special.

The one thing that really stood out was the mocktail – it was excellent. Other than that, the meal didn’t leave a lasting impression, and I wouldn’t recommend it based on this experience.

I’m sure this is because each dish is an impressive amount of work and is prepared fresh.
Some of the food was exceptional. A huge shout out for the lamb cannelloni, the crab starter, the lamb meatballs, the tagines and the Semifredo. All 7 of us left very very well fed.
The setting (in a sad looking parade of shops in Edgebaston) belies the quality of what you will experience.

Checking Google maps for restaurants nearby I came across with this Italian restaurant Buonissimo. Pretty from the pictures, attractive menu just I wasn’t sure if they do take away so I called. Pretty little voice answered, that was Irma. I explained what I want and she only had to check with chef if food collection was ok.
Chef Mark comes on the phone and he finds out that I am in hospital and family will come to collect food etc. Next thing he starts recommending what he believes it’s suitable for me, about the food texture and storage everything that I needed but I didn’t know nothing about it.
Cut the story short, my family picked up the food and delivered to me with a lovely note from Irma and chef Mark, a wonderful bunch of flowers and of course a delightful Tiramisu from them ❤️.
I have no words to describe the feelings and the emotions I felt. The food I had was Pate D’anatra as starters and Rigatoni alla Buonissimo, sorry I have no pictures of the food but I have photos of the most touching gesture I have ever had in my life !!!
Thank you so much for the good wishes🙏🏼
Food was amazing, delightful taste, I believe the bread is baked in the house. Outstanding Customers service, very friendly team.

The fact that it's still here is a testament to what they do.
The stairs up to the restaurant don't do the place justice, inside is eclectic but I guess most people will like it.
The next thing you will probably notice, especially at this time of the year is that it has air conditioning which we really appreciated.
The staff are very friendly, a bit quick off the mark for us but they are patient and helpful. Typical Bangladeshi menu, perhaps a bit light on specials but there is something there for everyone. The waiter was pushing one dish but by now I know what I like. The drinks choice is pretty good, pinot grigio by the glass and Bombay Bycicle in bottles as well as a very nice Cobra on draught.
The chutney trays accompanying the poppadoms were the best I have had, ever.
The sheekh kebab was quite hot and flavoursome but I prefer a finer minced lamb. The salad was excellent and it came fried onions which is not always the case in Harborne.
The mains and sides were perfect for us, couldn't fault anything. None of that tri-colour food colouring in pilau rice either.
Portion are very generous and we ordered too much, however we now have two takeaways in the freezer.

I absolutely love the chips here at Gabriels. Why? Well it starts with the easy parking despite being at the top of the busy Harborne High Street. With some spaces on the road and additional spaces on the car park (just remember to enter your car reg on the tablet on the counter in the shop!).
Then the actual shop is very smartly presented and clean. You can even see the food being prepared and your order being made out.
The staff are so nice and polite that you feel you stepped in your own kitchen. And they dress clean and tidy which is so important for me.
But the food is where it is actually at. The chips are without doubt the best I have ever had and I have eaten all over the world. They are the best potatoes for sure and they are cooked to perfection. Neither undercooked nor overly heated. And they are always fresh. Never reheated either.
I just couldn't resist in putting my box of chips on the ground outside the shop to capture a photo of the delicious chips today. YUMMY YUMMY, HAPPY TUMMY :)",2025-04-28 03:28:56,en

They then told me that it was their policy to not let in anyone not British as although my parents ARE English I am from Belgium. This had never been an issue since moving to the uk.

Avoid this pub if you are not white as you will get bad looks from staff and other people in the pub. It was a very unpleasant experience. Didn't realise it was a whites only pub by the looks of it.

Update 27th April 2025: Not a good visit at all today. Had a Guinness. Everyone else was served first when it was clear mt turn was overlooked. Asked if the match volume coul dbe turned on but told no , yet when others asked it was put on immiditaly. And then to top it all off, when I got halfway down the Guinness I discovered the glass had a huge filthy mark on the inside. Hadn't been cleaned when filled. Made me feel physically sick and I left it and the pub and probably wont ever return. Downgraded accordingly. I feel queezy even now thinking about it.

Held a corporate event here and can't fault the service provided by Liam and the team. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a function venue in the centre of Birmingham. The only warning I would put out is don't park in the multi storey campus car park which I did by mistake as there is free venue parking at weekends... Multi storey is £25 to park here on a Sunday afternoon. Thankfully Liam sorted this out for us but I was stunned at the rate being demanded.

As for the Pavilion, as a said - staff were all very helpful and friendly. The food was great for both flavour and quantity. The room arrangement worked really well - bar area with separate room to sit and eat. Toilets were also within booked area so didn't have to go out to public space and that helped make  the event feel very private.

The service was excellent – friendly staff and everything was brought out in good time.

I had the chicken wrap, which was packed with flavour, juicy chicken, and a nice kick of spice. The chips were crispy and well-seasoned, and the pasta was creamy and comforting – perfect as a side dish.

To note, the menu says signature chips, but it's just regular chips, albeit they weren't greasy or thin french fries.

Even ordered a doggy bag to go.

Overall, it was really solid food, generous portions, and a place I’d happily return to. Great value and quality!

I ate here recently and was very disappointed. Firstly, they didn't acknowledge me as I waited to be served. I was waiting for at least 5 minutes before I got fed up and asked for service.  I selected my dish and paid. I paid more than the average price for the food, so here's me expecting a more generous portion with explosive flavours, but the portion was less than the average portion and the flavours were bland or overpowering. The oxtail was more bone than anything, and the steam veg portion was minimal. The rice lacked flavour, as did the meat, and I was just really disappointed. Then, I decided to order a piece of jerk chicken from the drum outside. That came to the table, and it wasn't steaming like the other food. Tasted it, and it was cold. When I then told the young woman the chicken was cold, she then went on to lie to me and tell me it had just come off the drum from outside. I'm certain that did not just come off the drum from outside as  it was cold and did not taste fresh. I wouldn't eat here again as there is nothing authentic about this shop or the food, and the young woman who lied to me did kill any hopes of a better rating. There was a young black guy in there who, if I weren't for him, then I would give this place the lowest rating possible. He made the experience enjoyable for me by asking me if the food was alrite and if I needed anything else and just generally a well-spoken, attentive, polite young man. Avoid this place if you can, as you will be greatly disappointed if you taste their so-called authentic food. Also, the price paid and the food of that low quality. Not again",2025-01-05 11:49:54,en

When we asked for tea, a staff member turned around angrily and told us we would have to wait. When I inquired about their rude behavior, they simply replied that they were short-staffed and had too many customers.

I ordered a vegan burger and a bacon cheese (beef) burger with Uber Eats from GBK.  When my food arrived (stone cold), neither of the burgers were labelled.  They looked identical, meaning that, without the labels, it was impossible to identify which burger was vegan and which contained meat.  Neither of the burgers contained bacon, meaning that we could not even use the bacon to identify which burger was the meat burger - and increased the possibility that our order was just wrong and that both burgers were beef burgers!

When we contacted GBK, they were really rude and offered no help whatsoever; we were not offered a replacement or a refund.  Uber Eats only gave us a 79p refund on a £22 order to cover the delivery charge rather than the mix up with the food.  This meant that we were unable to eat our meal and ended up £22 out of pocket and having to buy food from elsewhere.

Unbelievably disappointed.  If you have dietary requirements especially, I would strongly suggest not eating/ordering from here.",2022-08-09 13:22:14,en

I ordered fried piece biryani, but instead, they served a dish with a tomato-flavored gravy and cold chicken pieces. When we explained the issue to the waiter, he dismissively insisted it was fried piece biryani and told us to eat it, claiming it would taste nice. I’ve never encountered such an unprofessional response.

Additionally, the family dum biryani we ordered for our group was served cold, completely lacking in flavor and hygiene. As a Hyderabadi, I know what authentic biryani should taste like, but this was utterly disappointing. They couldn’t even manage to serve hot food, let alone focus on taste or quality. I seriously question how this restaurant meets food hygiene and safety standards.

I strongly recommend avoiding this place. It’s a waste of time and money, especially given their poor hygiene and substandard service.",2025-04-23 15:39:31,en

Chicken Dum Biryani – hands down 10/10. If you like your food spicy (like I do — the spicier the better), this place hits the spot. You can actually talk to the restaurant about the spice level, which is great. The rice was super fragrant and packed with flavor. I usually only have biryani every few months, but in the last 3 weeks alone, I’ve already had it three times here. That says something!

Tried the Chicken Liver with Tandoori Naan today — wow. It was amazing and honestly made me a bit homesick. Haven’t had liver since I was back home, and this took me right back. So good.

Then we had the Masala Chai — it comes in a smaller cup than I’d usually go for, but considering the price, it makes sense. Plus, it was really good! Totally recommend it after your meal.

The vibe at the place is great, and the service has been one of the best I’ve experienced in Birmingham so far. It gets pretty busy in the evenings, but it’s super chill during the day — perfect if you’re looking to grab lunch and maybe get some work done (I usually catch up on emails there).

Probably my longest review yet, but definitely worth writing. I’ll keep updating as I try more dishes!",2025-04-16 16:26:36,en

Mind you it's never been good but never this bad either.

They speak little English which is fine cuz you can just point at the menu but they treat non-Chinese customers differently. No basic customer service skills, no communication. The only times I've felt welcome here was when I would come with my Hong Kong friend. The girl who took my order looked almost bothered by my presence there but smiled at Chinese customers. Rude tone too.

Ordered kung pao chicken and the A1 option. When I got home I realized she didn't give me the chicken dish but another beef one. I don't know how she misunderstood since there's no beef dish next to it on the menu. They used to put a tea egg in the rice but not anymore which is disappointing. They sometimes give free soup with your order. Except that today I had to ask for it even tho the takeaway order before mine got free soup and so did everyone at the tables inside.

The food itself is good, tho the A1 option was just decent, the ""sauce"" is just red oil that sinks to the bottom and doesn't give much flavor so I wouldn't recommend it.

Good if you want to try more ""authentic"" Chinese food but you'll probably be treated differently if you're not Chinese.",2023-10-04 14:10:50,en

I’ve been shopping at M&S FOOD for nearly 20 years & never felt the need to write a review, but their cookies deserve it. Honestly, they are the best cookies I’ve ever had. They come in three flavours, classic choc chip, triple choc and oat The triple choc are my go-to. They’re unbelievably tasty, rich, & baked to perfection.
Recently, they released a new filled range, hazelnut chocolate, raspberry cheesecake & pistachio. They’re good, but nothing beats the original cookies!
Now for the warning! These cookies turn people into contestants on Supermarket Sweep. The moment they hit the shelves it’s chaos, trolleys crashing, people diving like it’s the Olympics, & that one person pretending to browse while secretly guarding the last pack.

This same Asian staff member also pretends not to understand your accent when you ask for directions if you’re Asian, claiming her English is not good, but then looks at you provocatively and leaves you alone, ignoring your question.

As the most expensive supermarket chain, I don’t mind paying more money than at other supermarkets, but I believe you should increase your wage budget.

Either the spices are way too overpowering, or the flavour just isn’t there. So when my friend mentioned a new takeaway called Dr Shawarma that opened just 5 minutes from where I live, I wasn’t in a rush to try it. I thought, “Here we go again, nothing new.”

But tonight hunger hit hard, and as I was driving down Bristol Road, I spotted Dr Shawarma and thought, “You know what, let’s give it a go.” I told myself I’d get the chicken shawarma meal — and if it flopped, at least I’d still have the chips to fall back on.

There was a bit of a queue, but it moved quickly. The staff were really friendly, and I got my food quicker than expected. Now here’s the real moment… I opened the shawarma not expecting much, took a bite and OH MY — absolutely delicious. The flavour was spot on, tasted genuinely like something you’d get in the Middle East. It had that perfect balance of spices, not overpowering at all. And the chips? Fresh, crunchy, and actually worth mentioning!

I honestly loved it. I’d give it a solid 8/10, and trust me, that’s the rating I’d give even in the Middle East.

You’d think expectations would be low – after all, it’s just chicken, right? But there are still plenty of ways it can go wrong.

Let’s start with the chicken: overall, it tasted great. I went for the super hot and it was a good balance of spice and flavour – definitely the highlight of the meal. However, the spicy rice was a big letdown. It wasn’t spicy at all, extremely sticky, and honestly gave off the impression it had been cooked days ago and reheated. It felt more like sushi rice than anything that should come with grilled chicken.

The best way to describe the whole experience is this: like your local takeaway trying to be Nando’s. Tables weren’t clean – the place was quiet with barely anyone around, and yet when I sat down, my arm landed on a sticky, dirty surface. Not the best first impression.

The one real positive was the service – friendly and helpful. And because the chicken wasn’t bad, it’s not a 1-star review. But overall, there’s a lot of room for improvement.",2025-06-24 22:10:00,en

Groups of paramedics, patients, hospital staff and visitors were all involved in some form of conversation during order taking and whilst making collections.  I was really surprised for some reason. It was good to see.

One member of staff went above and beyond helping me with a phone issue I had and considering the circumstances of why I am at the QE today waiting she has no idea how much I value that gesture of kindness.

I feel that the management of this cafe should recognise and reward all the team members working today as they really are doing a great job and are a credit to Costa Coffee.

The staff is dishonest and rude.

I should've read the reviews before coming but I didn't, as many others agree that the staff is rude.

I came to buy a £4 meal deal, which fits my budget as a student. The meal deal includes a sandwich, a drink, and a snack. However, the particular sandwich I picked up wasn't included in the meal deal, so I ended up paying £7.90, it's my fault really, but the staff was annoyed when I asked.

I was gonna buy a cup of tea but I've already used up my lunch budget, so I asked the staff politely if she could fill my cup with some hot water please, she told me that their hot water machine is broken too, same as the one in library lounge. Yes the one in library lounge is broken, that's why I asked if I could get some hot water from the café, after paying for a meal as a customer. But the machine in the café isn't broken. All other customers behind me all managed to get tea that's filled with hot water.

I didn’t try the full menu since I wasn’t very hungry, but I did have a raspberry and chocolate muffin. Both the coffee and muffin were brought to my table, and I was pleasantly surprised to see the muffin served on a warm plate—a thoughtful touch that added to the experience.

The café is located near the university and is popular with students. Listening to their conversations brought back fond memories of my own student days.

It’s not a full five-star experience, mainly due to the slightly steep prices—but overall, a charming place worth visiting.

Previously have gone places and got a decent amount of food. when complaining about the amount of food given they told us it was all locally sourced. However, if this is true we would personally want to be educated on where it is sourced and be educated on this, as when going cheddar that was what happened. However, the cheese and meat seemed to be poor quality as seen in picture and was thinly sliced which does not seem to be high quality, seemed more like a processed meat selection. It also did not state this anywhere on menus or walls ect. When we complained they also pushed back saying they understand we are students but we looked at the menu beforehand and was looking at spending about £20 each as was my birthday meal, and that was not the point of why we were upset with our food. Left feeling very underwhelmed and disappointed. Seems a steep price for what you get as no information shared, the board didn’t seem a really quality and you got about 10 slices of meat for £20. It also stated it came with crackers but i can’t see any on this picture. service was good as told us nice wines and made recommendations however when we complained they did nothing about the situation and pushed back with reasons we were not informed on",2025-05-16 09:21:32,en

Strawberry mojitos were something else. Perfect flavour to compliment the deserts.

My experience was horrible I felt so out of place and actually thought I was at the wrong venue . So after waiting in a queue in a busy coffe shop for over 10 minutes I finally got to the counter where I had to announce in front of everyone waiting in the queue behind me my reason for being there . Which was not ideal and I did question if I was actually at the right place . The ladies behind the counter were lovely and friendly but as I wasn’t asking for a coffee it took her two times of me explaining before she understood why I was there . I was then taken to a corridor where there was again a lovely lady who helped me but said it’s more a drop in hub for students and to maybe try a different one . I felt so uncomfortable there as I wasn’t asking for the only person there over 30 and even if I’d wanted to purchase a coffe it was out of my price range I think the cheapest one was £5.00 so who ever said students are broke haven’t been around students these days . The whole experience was uncontrollable and not to mention parking I had to park theee streets away and walk a good 10 minutes .

We ordered two of the grills and two hot drinks. Our drinks came pretty sharpish but after 25 minutes we started to wonder where the food was. The couple on the table next to us had theirs and they arrived a good 10 mins after us. We flagged down a waitress who never apologized for the wait but chased up our food - ""it's being plated up now""....20 minutes later we still didn't have our food. We flagged someone else down who immediately just said ""well it's busy isn't it"", not busy enough to stand and gossip round the coffee machine. We mentioned our drinks were long gone at this point and we were just getting annoyed. A further 10 minutes later and our food finally arrived, (55 minutes after we ordered), the lady didn't even speak to us. No apologies, no 'do you need anything else', 'any more drinks'. Nothing. Noone checked back on us and when we left, no one would make eye contact.
The food was absolutely delightful - it's just a shame I won't be back due to inpolite and rude staff members. I fully understand mistakes happen and orders do get lost but manners do go a long way and an apology and/or even the offer of even a tap water would have made the situation a lot more pleasant.",2025-03-17 15:43:39,en

The issue was the service. On arrival we were seated in the garden and provided with drinks menus for a pre lunch drink. After 10 minutes of waiting for a waiter I had to wonder round the restaurant looking for someone to take my order. From this point everything went fine until after the third course. Nobody removed our dirty plates, nobody came to offer coffee. Again I had to leave my seat and go and search for a member of staff, only to find four or five staff members congregating around the bar having a chat! Even after I commented that we were feeling somewhat abandoned there was no apology. As it was my friends birthday lunch I didn't want to discuss it further at the time so I just paid the bill and left with our dirty plates still on the table. This may seem like a small thing, however when I am paying nearly £200 per head, including a £45 service charge, at a Michelin star restaurant I would expect exceptional service. I have been dining at Simpsons for several years and always found it a wonderful experience. Sadly I think this will be my last visit as personally I go to restaurants such as this not only for the food but for the theatre.

I had the absolute pleasure of visiting The Blue Piano in Edgbaston, and what an evening it was! I made the trip especially to see the incredibly talented Dr Stephen Tromans perform, and he did not disappoint. From the moment he and the other musicians took the stage, the energy in the room was electric.

The music was nothing short of breathtaking—rich, soulful, and deeply moving. I found myself listening with my eyes closed, heart open, completely lost in the magic unfolding before me. Stephen Tromans plays with such passion and skill; his connection to the music is something truly special. I was absolutely blown away.

The atmosphere at The Blue Piano only enhanced the experience. It’s an intimate and vibrant venue, perfect for live jazz. The warmth of the crowd, the outstanding musicianship, and the sheer beauty of the music made it an evening to remember. The venue’s commitment to showcasing top-quality jazz acts really sets it apart, making it a must-visit for any jazz lover.

I travelled quite a distance just to see Stephen Tromans perform, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. His presence brought something truly special to the venue, and it was clear I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. I really hope The Blue Piano books him again soon—he and the other musicians created an unforgettable experience, and I know many would love the chance to experience it again.

I had an incredible dining experience at Three Church Road Restaurant. The food was absolutely amazing—each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavour. The quality of the ingredients and attention to detail truly stood out, making every bite a delight.

The service was exceptional, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere from start to finish. A special mention to Vinny, who was brilliant—attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making our meal even more enjoyable. His recommendations were spot on, and his professionalism added to the overall experience.

The only minor downside is that parking at the location can be a bit tricky. However, there’s plenty of parking nearby, so it’s not a major issue.

Overall, Three Church Road is a fantastic place for a meal, whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just enjoying a great night out. Highly recommended!",2025-02-15 08:22:35,en

The Three Church Road restaurant is a bit hard to access - there are main doors with a sign saying the entrance is to the left, and you walk through what I think is the reception to the retirement home? It’s not very clear but we were able to find it without too much hassle.

The restaurant/bar is very beautifully designed, with lots of different rooms and areas to keep it feeling intimate and private, rather than everyone packed in one big room. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and made it a lovely occasion.

We’d come for the afternoon tea, which seems to be good value at £19.95 but was rather disappointing - largely due to the pretty boring sandwich flavours (tuna, ham & mustard, cheddar & chutney, and chicken tandoori) and the fillings were absolutely tiny - I don’t think I tasted any tuna. The staff were great in tailoring the food to dietary requirements, for vegans, gluten free, and generally fussy people who just wanted an entire plate of ham sandwiches! It was just sad they’d not opted for things such as smoked salmon and cream cheese, egg and cress, and cucumber sandwiches.

And the finger sandwiches came heaped in butter - a white margarine spreadable type thing. Sad. There were scones with individual pots of cream and jam, and a range of cakes though I found these to be quite dry.

Particularly with the sandwiches there felt like a lot of cost-cutting had been going on, and you could barely taste any of the fillings. You can pay £5 extra to enjoy Champagne with your afternoon tea, or gin & tonics.

Despite my disappointment with the food, it looked beautiful and was a lovely thing to do with friends, and we were very well looked after by the staff.",2023-04-17 21:46:07,en

We started our meal with the Joojeh Koftah Kebab, which was presented well but could have been better in terms of flavor. However, the rest of the dishes truly impressed us. The Sultani Lamb Chops were succulent and well-seasoned, and the Kabuli Pulav stood out with its rich aroma and perfectly balanced flavors. Each dish was plated beautifully, adding to the overall dining experience.

To accompany our meal, we tried two drinks—Persian Sage and Persepolis—both of which were refreshing and paired well with the food.

What made the evening even more special was the thoughtful gesture from the staff. Knowing it was our anniversary, they greeted us with a personalized card and a plate of delicious baklava. The baklava was flaky, sweet, and just the right end to our meal.

They have always been so warm and welcoming, especially with kids, and of course the pizza (gorgonzola and pear all time fave) and cocktails (chilli and yuzu margaritas please) are stunning.

The above led us to approach them to ask if they would host a small wedding reception for us and our nearest and dearest (around 30 people) which Clare and Paul accepted enthusiastically. They were so easy to work with especially in the run up to our big day, nothing was too much trouble and they absorbed much of the stress that comes with planning any event let alone your own wedding.

When it came to the day, the room was decorated beautifully (by Sophie I believe) and everything from the food to the service was flawless. The staff were so genuinely kind, relaxed and accomodating which created a lovely atmosphere for our celebration. We even arrived a little earlier than planned and this was no trouble at all. All of our guests (including vegans and other dietary requirements) were catered for perfectly and have all vowed to visit again.

Clare & Paul were also kind enough to also let us use an extra (also spacious) side room for the kids and even brought out toys etc for them to play with. This was something which meant we could really enjoy ourselves without having to occupy our very busy 2 year old!

We have never experienced such good hospitality and would highly recommend not only eating at Smoke & Ash once a week for the rest of your life, but also booking them for any similar gathering you might be planning. Thank you everyone for a perfect day.

Kids meal-deal margherita pizza was a big hit (a generous size to feed hungry children). Adults went for the deli charcuterie board, Bresaola cured beef pizza and the daily special pizza (asparagus and ham from memory). Food was fantastic. Drinks were great. Followed it all up with kid's ice creams, stole a spoon of my wife's chocolate + pear tart, which was delicious. Can't comment on my own dessert (panna cotta) as kids asked to try and then ate it all. Guess it's a good reason to return. I highly recommend Smoke + Ash.",2025-06-05 11:43:02,en

We were a group of 3; my husband, son & I.
The whole experience was fabulous. The space is stylish, tables are a good distance apart & there are acoustic pads on the ceiling ensuring a non-echoey restaurant so we could hear each other very easily & the music was set at a low comfortable level too. We had cocktails to start followed by the excellent £40 lunch menu - all served at the right pace with very attentive waitresses & waiters. The food was beautifully presented, seasoned well & hot. Between the main course & dessert, we were asked whether we had a reason for coming & I said it was our son’s birthday & they very generously piped a happy birthday on the plate they served his crème brûlée on … which I thought was wonderful - the waitress had listened, responded & bought this unexpected accolade to him. He was delighted as were we. Overall one of the best meals we have had in a long time & great value too. 10/10. Would we go again! Yes - definitely. Highly recommended!",2025-03-09 08:30:22,en

Upon arrival, we were greeted and decided to have a drink at the bar. From there, you can sample the great selection of drinks and see the open kitchen with chefs preparing the food to a high standard. It was also a good opportunity to get a view of the dishes available, which all looked amazing and helped us decide on what to go for.

After finishing our drinks, we were seated and ordered our starters. The pork belly starter was absolutely amazing and melted in your mouth. The flavour and quality was outstanding and I can still remember the great taste. Moving onto mains, I went for the lamb, which again did not disappoint. We all ordered different mains, so there was a wide range on the table, which was visually stunning.

I could not fault anything during my time here, the staff also went the extra mile and presented me with a birthday desert at the end which was very kind of them and added that final touch to my birthday dinner.

This is fine dining to high standard, and I would recommend to anyone looking for a special place for the right occasion. I look forward to returning here and would recommend it to all.

With about 15 acres to explore you could easily spend 3-4hrs here!

Perfect for a nice relaxed afternoon if you go during the week, I imagine it's quite a bit busier on the weekends and school holidays.

Be aware that the hot-houses are very hot and humid! Probably 30-35? so if you go in the colder months make sure you can remove some layers easily.

The grounds are broadly wheelchair accessible, with sloping ramps. Although if possible take someone who is able to open doors as one door in the cacti room to an accessible ramp does get stuck and some slopes (while gentle for those walking) could be a little steep for a manual chair.

Plenty of benches around, some in the sun and some in the shade as well as a large gazebo-like structure near the rose garden you could duck into if it rains.

Perfect for kiddos, if you park yourself in the cafe with a view to the hothouse door you can safely send them off on their own to run around for hours. There is a plat area as well if that's more their thing than running through bushes.

Love the little shop, lots of gardening bits as well as cards, pottery and artwork all priced fairly high as you would expect for any garden centre/ public attraction.

The pastries were outstanding; crispy, fresh, and full of flavour. The pistachio and almond croissants were beautifully done, and that chocolate hazelnut dessert was a showstopper, rich and perfectly balanced. The presentation was elegant and the vibe of the place warm and welcoming..

The service was warm and attentive, and the entire space feels thoughtfully designed – from the plush seating to the natural light pouring through the windows. The food and drinks were equally delightful, offering a fresh and flavourful selection that matched the ambience perfectly.

Highly recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth or looking for a perfect coffee break",2025-05-29 22:23:14,en

Spent a lovely afternoon with the wife at this cafe. It was calm and minimalistic, with a clean aesthetic and a really relaxing vibe. I enjoyed a smooth and well-balanced espresso with a beautifully presented black forest slice and there was certainly no complaints from the better half who opted for a strawberry tartlet and latte. Staff were warm, attentive, and made us feel welcome without being overbearing.

Would love to see a V60 pour over on the menu in the future — it would be a perfect fit for the space and give filter coffee fans a reason to linger. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys thoughtful coffee and a peaceful atmosphere.",2025-07-10 10:36:13,en

Super busy coffee shop, the coffee was really beautiful, I really love when I get a good cup of coffee! Their croissants are so beautiful and fluffy, and the little pyramid cake was so yummy! I also tried the goat cheese and fig pastry which I highly recommend, it was such a nice mix of sweet and savoury. Before I left, I treated myself to a box of chocolates because I tried the Salted Vanilla and the Strawberry cheesecake and was blown away by the quality. Everything felt thoughtful and well-made. I’ll definitely be coming back to try out many more beautiful things that they have. Great addition to Edgbaston.",2025-05-06 23:12:23,en

After following their tempting Instagram presence, we finally visited this newly opened French-inspired patisserie in Edgbaston's elegant Highfield Road. Housed in one of the area's magnificent white period buildings, Cake & Culture immediately impresses with its stunning interior design and presentation.

The display counter is a feast for the eyes, showcasing an array of expertly crafted pastries and cakes, all freshly prepared on-site. As pistachio enthusiasts, we couldn't resist their pistachio croissants paired with pistachio-flavoured iced lattes - a combination that rivalled the best we've experienced since our visits to Sydney. The handmade chocolates that followed (naturally, also pistachio-flavoured) were absolutely divine, demonstrating the establishment's commitment to quality and attention to detail.

The service matched the exceptional food quality, with the team professionally presented in branded C&C attire, delivering attentive and knowledgeable service. The entire experience, from the elegant setting to the exquisite patisserie offerings, creates an authentic French café atmosphere in the heart of Edgbaston.

We're already planning regular visits to sample their entire range of treats - our Slimming World commitments will have to take a temporary backseat!",2025-05-22 14:10:18,en

Housed in one of the estate’s beautiful listed buildings, this high-end coffee shop is as much about atmosphere as it is about flavour.

The setting is quirky yet refined — a tasteful blend of modern elegance and classic charm that fits perfectly with its upscale surroundings. It’s the kind of place that feels just right for a quiet coffee date, a casual business meeting, or even a solo afternoon with your laptop (yes, there are plenty of sockets).

What truly sets Cake & Culture apart is its attention to detail, especially in its selection of artisan chocolates. I sampled a few of the more unique flavours — Bergamot & Lime, Passion Fruit Mango & Coconut, and Banana Pecan. Each one was a revelation: bold, beautifully balanced, and utterly delicious. If you’re even mildly curious, they’re absolutely worth a try.

I also indulged in a cheese croissant, which was elevated with roasted tomato and peppers. The result? Warm, flaky, and bursting with flavour — a definite must-have on the menu.

But let’s talk coffee — the real test of any café. I ordered my go-to flat white, and I’m happy to report it did not disappoint. Smooth, rich, and expertly brewed, it easily holds its own in a city that’s spoilt for good coffee.

Whether you’re here for the ambience, the coffee, or the inventive sweet treats, Cake & Culture is a standout spot that brings something truly special to Birmingham’s café scene. Highly recommended.

Big shout out to Jono and Wika who are equal to the task of taking care of this opulent place",2025-07-01 11:30:00,en

The room was tired and looked as if it gets zero maintenance. I asked for a double but had 2 single beds pushed together they were not secured so separated during the night causing a gap. I was concerned with the hygiene of the room as there were cobwebs above the mirror and ceiling. The light pull cord was filthy and there was no handle on the inside of the shower. Lighting in the room was awful they still use the old bulbs which emit yellow light the main ceiling lampshade had dead flies inside. I mentioned all this to reception who offered me another room I declined and requested its cleaned tomorrow. When I retuned next day after room was serviced it was exactly the same very poor housekeeping standards. Bar and restaurant is across the road in the main centre very pleasant but mega expensive i.e. bottle of pale ale £6.50. There are no bars or shops near so its a long walk or taxi every time you need to go out if you dont drive like me.

We left the 3 windows open which were on the ceiling as we were on the top floor. However when we got back the room had filled with leaves from the trees above making a mess everywhere!

The only time I saw any staff was when checking in and you now have to phone a number to talk to ""reception"" who are off site.

When my key card failed, the reception gave us the code to a keybox to obtain one of their master keys that could open any door in the hotel. It was quite unnerving knowing that any other guest could get into any room, especially as the  deadbolt on the door to my room did not work. With no staff on site, other guests were also unchallenged when arguing loudly near my room.

The fire alarm was also sounding on the second night of my stay and showing a fault code. When calling reception  they struggled to understand the issue and said they had finished for the day and wanted me to send an email so that someone else could deal with it! Someone did come, but they only silenced it rather than sorting whatever the fault was.

Whilst the rooms are still nice and the location is good, there was a skip outside the hotel and I genuinely thought it had closed down when I first arrived. There is no longer a restaurant/bar either as that is now a separate business.

With a little work this could be a great hotel again but the lack of staff and resulting safety issues would really put me off staying again.",2025-02-22 10:46:36,en

Everybody was so friendly and helpful from reception staff , dental nurses and the dentist herself was lovely. I didn’t feel  rushed and she was very thorough in her examination of my teeth and gums giving me options regarding what needs to be done .
She also took the time to have a little chat with me about my work and what my day had in store .
Whilst I was waiting in the waiting room a lovely older lady came in and when the dental nurse called her to go to see the dentist she was just so nice with her , greeted her with a lovely smile and to maintain eye contact with the lady the nurse walked backwards and confined her conversation and then as the lady was not great on her feet she offered to take her bag and she walked behind her up the stairs .
To sum up it was just so nice to see everybody  greeted with a smile , and just being friendly and nice and also very professional,
which can be rare these days .",2025-07-08 08:39:19,en

I am very fortunate to have Dr. Jannat Mohammad as my dentist. She was very thorough in examining me and devising a treatment plan. The fillings she has done have relieved me of a lot of discomfort and pain. She has patiently answered all my queries and even called me back to explain things I was not clear about the first time. She is a gentle, compassionate, and excellent dentist. The reception staff (in particular, Azeem and Sharan) are very courteous, helpful and professional. They were very helpful when I requested my dental records from the first consultation. It has been a pleasure to interact with them. All in all, I am very happy with the Dental Centre.

My daughter attended Elms from the day after she turned 1 until she was the right age to move to the same school as her elder brother. As is normal, she cried when dropped and collected for the first few weeks but by week 6 she was leaping into the arms of her carers at Elms.

Emma in the Squirrel was my complete favourite because I always felt she loved my daughter as though she were her own and as such they had a fantastic bond. That kind of care made it so easy for me to go to work every day.

Whenever I dealt with the nursery managers regarding admin issues, they were responsive, reasonable and accomodating.

Upon arrival, the receptionist was very friendly. He gently and respectfully guided me to where I needed to go for my appointment. His mannerism and smile were uplifting. The receptionist on the floor of the physician was the same.

As regards my appointment, I was greeted by Dr. Deepali Misra-Sharpe and my appointment started right on time. She listened intently to what I was saying, and was compassionate. This was also reflected in the professionally written report she sent to me post-visit.

Most exceptional was Ms. Mita Tanna: Patient Administrator. She truly went above and beyond merely implementing her ‘professional’ duties in a timely manner.
