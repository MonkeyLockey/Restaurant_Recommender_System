The food was that good, we surprised ourselves by finishing it all off and not taking any home with us like we normally do.

There was that traditional desi pub ambience, but it was surprisingly quiet for a city centre eatery. I was there from before 7pm to after 8pm on a Thursday evening, and in that entire time there were only two other customers in there, who were just having a few drinks.

I rang them a few days beforehand and I was assured they use meat which is NOT produced in accordance with any religious faith. Sampled the veg mixed grill platter and was very impressed. Very tasty indeed.

Went to sample the food. The Saag was lovely and flavourful and the meat grill platter was also good. All in all, a nice mid week treat.

Used to be Jungle Bird before it closed permanently and saw that it’s now a new place so got curious and popped in for a drink. Didn’t eat so can’t comment on the food. People are super friendly though and love seeing a selection of beer on draft that you don’t tend to see elsewhere. A chilled place to hangout and watch a bit of sport. Will 100% come back to try the food. Fabulous wraps and masala chips - had a peel at the next tables curries -they also looked brilliant, lovely friendly staff. Hopefully this place will get as popular as their old premises - it was a bit lacking in atmosphere due to lack of customers - well worth trying and I’m sure it will soon be a must go to place. Quite a simple pub, serving excellent Indian food, with good service.
The menu is board and each item I had was good in it's own right. They were happy to customise the grill to my taste, and enquired if it was fine.
Good job. Its a busy place booking a table would be smart. Went here with some mates. The beer was flat so had to have it replaced and the mixed grill was disappointing. The tandoori chicken tastes like it was made earlier and warmed up in the microwave, dry and hard. Also had to ask for salad and additional sauces, most places give you bottles and salad as included but we were charged for a plate of salad that came out towards the end of the meal. Would not visit this place again. The place was empty on a Saturday night. The butter chicken was definitely not butter chicken, just some random generic  sauce with dry chicken pieces in it.",0.8,0.0,"[""Indian"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Ethiopian""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks""]"

Held a corporate event here and can't fault the service provided by Liam and the team. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a function venue in the centre of Birmingham. The only warning I would put out is don't park in the multi storey campus car park which I did by mistake as there is free venue parking at weekends... Multi storey is £25 to park here on a Sunday afternoon. Thankfully Liam sorted this out for us but I was stunned at the rate being demanded.

As for the Pavilion, as a said - staff were all very helpful and friendly. The food was great for both flavour and quantity. The room arrangement worked really well - bar area with separate room to sit and eat. Toilets were also within booked area so didn't have to go out to public space and that helped make  the event feel very private.

8 would recommend and use again.... The Bournbrook Pavilion is the University of Birmingham residence hall that is closest to the university. And it is situated in the Selly Oak village. Selly Oak is known as a student town. A variety of student eateries and stores are within walking distance. The hostel is close to Aldi, Tesco, and Sainsbury's supermarkets. Bournbrook Pavilion is about 300-200 metres away from the University of Birmingham. Nice simple food, cost effective lunch, quick service and nice staff.

This is definitely the place to come if you want expert advice and high quality products.
I visited the area on a sunny Saturday when it was very busy - cafes were packed and there was also an artisan market doing a roaring trade. Fab area. Visited the coffin museum and the jewellery shops.  Great vibes, lots of eateries and coffee shops. A place of men wandering on their own through a jungle of shiny things, looking a bit lost. Having said that, this is the place to go to get a good value, quality engagement ring. I ended up going with a bespoke shop elsewhere for the ring design but I bought the diamond in Birmingham. Although some are a little pushy, most of the shop assistants have the right level of patience to deal with (largely) men who just want the experience to end.

My advice to engagement ring shoppers would be to look around for half hour or so and then console yourself with a beer in one of the conveniently located pubs! Great place to find quality jewellery at good prices with a vast range of gold and diamonds Wonderful place and experience! Loads of expert independent jewellers and valuers.

The atmosphere was lively and welcoming, with stylish décor that gave a nice modern twist to traditional Vietnamese vibes.

The food was flavourful and well-presented, though it did take a bit of time to arrive. Prices were a little on the higher side for a casual meal, but the quality of the food made up for it.

For starters, my wife and I shared the chicken mango salad and duck dumplings. Both dishes were fresh, full of flavour, and nicely balanced — a great way to start the meal. The kids were happy with their chicken mains served with chips and salad — simple but tasty and well portioned.

For mains, I went for the Bun-Cha-Ha-Noi, which included fresh rice noodles, thinly sliced pork, king prawn meatballs, and a traditional spring roll. It was a delicious combination of textures and flavours. My wife had the grilled lemongrass chilli chicken — flame-grilled thighs marinated in a fragrant chilli blend — and she really enjoyed the spicy kick.

Overall, a great spot for something a bit different. We’d return again, especially for the unique flavours. Great service and amazing food. We were served quickly, and the food was really high quality with fantastic flavour. Recommend trying the cocktail of the month, this month's was great! We thoroughly enjoyed our night out at the Vietnamese Street Kitchen while attending an event in Birmigham. The food was delicious with lots of options and the staff were very helpful. The atmosphere was really good too. Will definitely be returning if we've business in Birmingham again I love their food very nice and filling, it satisfied my cravings today. All staff are welcoming. I was served by ruby today and she was very kind and helpful. I have been several times and will go again. We came here for lunch.

Also...There is a service charge added to your bill as standard. Although i believe in tipping when service is good i don't think it should be expected. Nice restaurant with rotating sushi conveyor belt all around the restaurant. The staff were really friendly and check on you to make sure everything is okay. I ordered a regular chicken noodle, but portion was a bit small in my opinion but still tasted good. Would recommend. We came here unplanned but were immediately seated  and ready to eat.

Recommend for Indian food. After a bit of a hiatus I went back to the dilshad this weekend. I honestly wanted to cry. It was as good as I remembered. Food was excellent.

Gotta say, I’d never had eggs and cheese like that before – absolutely delicious!
The staff were so friendly too. Special shout-out to the Iranian girl who was lovely, and the bloke (can’t remember his name!) who recommended some spots for me to check out in Digbeth. Loads of cool places to explore, so thank you both for the tips!
To be honest, I was a bit knackered when I came in and probably could’ve done with a nap right there and then. If I hadn’t been so tired, I’d have been even more buzzing about it all, haha. Anyway, cracking little spot – I’ll definitely swing by again next time I’m in Birmingham. Matee, I'm minging. Bloody love yaouw' 🤣 This is a great spot for classic cafe breakfasts. We had the Full English and the house omelette and both were super tasty. The restaurant itself is simple, the tables are quite close together but it runs like clockwork! Staff are super friendly and made us feel so welcome. Portions are generous, food is delicious and turnover is fast. A great experience! Want great tasting food, no fuss and brilliant service… then this second to none cafe is unmissable!! It would be a mistake to stay in your hotel and not venture out to this flavoursome location!!
The service is rapid! Food is served hot!!

But the coffee… wow!! The regular flat white is a full cup of coffee… and better tasting than your chain coffee houses!! I had a meal at Grand Central Kitchen recently, and overall it was okay. The prices were fair, especially for the central location, which I appreciated. The staff were friendly and service was quick.

That said, the food itself didn’t quite hit the mark for me. The dishes looked good, but were missing a bit of flavour – just felt like they needed a bit more seasoning or something to bring them to life. I’ve definitely had better meals elsewhere in Birmingham.

Still, it’s not a bad spot if you’re nearby and need a bite – clean, convenient, and decent value. I’d give it 4 stars overall, mostly for the service and price. What an amazing place. Staff is so friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, cannot fault this place. 10/10 for me.

Popped in for a coffee and purposely charged me for a regular instead of a large, which honestly made my day.  I went back less than an hour later for a dine in breakfast.

On weds when we went it was BYOB too so take your own if youre going on a wednesday. Defo coming back! Nice little restaurant, we had to pre order our meals. portions were big enough. Lamb cooked well but wasn’t too impressed with my Salmon tartare. The carrots were from frozen ones. For the price they charge I am sure they can do much better.
Very welcoming and attending! Overall we had a good time. 👌🏼 It was a lovely experience to feel authentic Spanish foods. But I hope they can launch lunch specialised menus as well. We ate splendidly at Don Diego’s last night, with every single dish being extremely flavoursome. The house wines were good and the service was great. We were a bit put off by there only being three tables of guests on a Thursday night but alphonso and Edoardo said that they struggle to cook more than that number of covers.  I’m sure this is because each dish is an impressive amount of work and is prepared fresh.
Some of the food was exceptional. A huge shout out for the lamb cannelloni, the crab starter, the lamb meatballs, the tagines and the Semifredo. All 7 of us left very very well fed.
The setting (in a sad looking parade of shops in Edgebaston) belies the quality of what you will experience.

The bouncers at the front told my cousin and I that they were not letting any one else into the bar. when we left two other people paid to get inside. when i approached the bouncer about this blatant discrimination he told me that he did not care and that i wasn't getting into the club that night. What made it even worse the ladies sitting behind the bouncers handling the money heard this and seemed unfazed. being a tourist from New York i have never been treated like this in a foreign country. I don't recommend anyone spend their money in a racist bar such as this. Absolutely dreadful place.
Went for my birthday, where my partner had booked a booth for us that day with the manager, to be laughed at by the bouncer and told that we could not enter, this was after making us wait for another bouncer to come and make a decision with him wether to let us in or not. There was about 20 people in there and to be honest they should of appreciated the business we would of given them. I’m 31 and my partner is 40, dressed well and cannot believe the attitudes from the bouncers. Will never visit this place ever again! Think it’s time to change your door team, don’t you? An awful bar. The bouncers were incredibly vulgar, had racist intent and laid hands on myself and my friends. They were selective of who was allowed into the club based on racial profiling, telling some “its over capacity” and others “you’re definitely not getting in” , “not a regular”. Ruined our entire night and bouncers were aggressive and fighting (both physically and verbally) when trying to ask why half of us suddenly wasn’t allowed in. Once id managed to get past the ten past two girls and walked across the sticky floor to the bar I decided I would definitely sit outside where its clean. The toilets are beyond disgusting....blocked at 6pm. Staff rude, they cant really be bothered. Not really somewhere id bother returning. I remember trying to get in here and being told "" we weren't dressed appropriately"" in smart shirts, jeans and shoes. Asked if we got changed and came back would they let us in, they said no.

First impressions, the location is lovely and once you've found the secure car park it is really convenient getting to the centre.

The room was lovely and well decorated. However it was so hot the thermostat said it was 27 degrees! We couldn't get the air con to circulate cold air and didn't have a fan. We left the 3 windows open which were on the ceiling as we were on the top floor. However when we got back the room had filled with leaves from the trees above making a mess everywhere!

So we had to sleep with the windows partially open and extremely hot. Then in the morning the birds made a lot of noise which continued when we shut the windows.

For the price I do feel it was quite expensive. But it was a lovely hotel and had a great location with parking. The metro has made this the place to be for a returning Brummy. The rooms are huge and the bath is divine as you can see from the pic. We will be back This was a great hotel a few years back but it's very different now and I didn't feel particularly safe staying there. The only time I saw any staff was when checking in and you now have to phone a number to talk to ""reception"" who are off site.

When my key card failed, the reception gave us the code to a keybox to obtain one of their master keys that could open any door in the hotel. It was quite unnerving knowing that any other guest could get into any room, especially as the  deadbolt on the door to my room did not work. With no staff on site, other guests were also unchallenged when arguing loudly near my room.

The fire alarm was also sounding on the second night of my stay and showing a fault code. When calling reception  they struggled to understand the issue and said they had finished for the day and wanted me to send an email so that someone else could deal with it! Someone did come, but they only silenced it rather than sorting whatever the fault was.

Whilst the rooms are still nice and the location is good, there was a skip outside the hotel and I genuinely thought it had closed down when I first arrived. There is no longer a restaurant/bar either as that is now a separate business.

With a little work this could be a great hotel again but the lack of staff and resulting safety issues would really put me off staying again. What a fantastic place. It is beautifully clean and well presented. The staff have been amazing. They accommodated for Parking my van and explained everything for the room, WiFi and Room service. I will definitely come here again. This modern hotel was a perfect find for us as we needed to be on Birmingham University Campus for a couple of reasons. We were welcomed warmly and were very impressed by the hotel facilities and architecture. Our room was very spacious, comfortable and air conditioned too, so perfect! En-suite and whole hotel was spotlessly clean and clearly well maintained. Evening meals in the bar were excellent, as was the service. Breakfast in the main restaurant was a buffet style, again, with excellent food and service. Really recommend and rate this hotel, and the whole experience.

Not dog friendly which is a shame but worth it anyway for sure. Absolutely love this place - it's been my go-to pub in Birmingham since I moved here.

If you think you’ve experienced the best Sunday roast, think again—because Rav and Jas at The Goat King have completely redefined the game. Their take on the classic roast, elevated with rich, flavorful saag, was nothing short of sublime. Every bite was a masterclass in balance, depth, and creativity. The meat was perfectly cooked, the saag was velvety and packed with warming spices, and the roast trimmings were spot-on.

The service matched the food—warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. Rav and Jas not only brought their culinary expertise to the table but also their passion and hospitality, making the experience feel both elevated and personal.

And the atmosphere? Effortlessly cool, with a buzz that made it feel like the place to be on a Sunday afternoon. Comforting, vibrant, and full of good energy—just like the food.

Already planning my next visit. If you haven’t been, go. And if you have—you know exactly what I’m talking about. Went for the first time last Friday & my friend and found the restaurant welcoming & unassuming and the portions large!

We both had the same starters and mains, as follows:

Starters"" Fritters of Desire"", consisting of Paneer, Feta , Halloumi, red onion, spinach, cauliflower, aubergine and potato tossed in masala mix fried in chickpea batter.

Ingredients were fresh and very tasty even if the portions were probably twice as large as needed!

Mains: The Goat King Special

Their signature dish, made of slow-cooked pulled goat curry served on and off the bone. Flavored with aromatic spices and herbs to enrich the meat and marrow to succulent perfection.

Served with rice and 2 soft, fluffy fritters, called  'Bhatura' which is a deep-fried leavened sourdough bread originating from the Indian subcontinent.

The goat was beautifully cooked and perfectly seasoned and was definitely some of the best meat I've eaten in any type of restaurant!

The light, rice infused Flying Buffalo Indian lager complimented the goat perfectly.

Rav, the owner/main chef and his wife are really friendly and Rav took time to sit with us & explain a bit about Sikh history and the importance of the food to their culture.

100% recommend The Goat King (also known as 24 Carrot Gold) for anyone wanting a change to their usual curry or mixed grills so popular in Birmingham's many Desi pubs!

Note: the food is totally non halal Fantastic tasting goat curry cooked in authentic home style. The breads are worth a visit on their own too.

Imported Indian lager is a nice touch.

Super friendly owners.

Well worth a visit.

Highly recommended. Delicious goat curry for mains. Chicken starters were tasty and it was so good. Came here all the way from Sydney, Australia. Rav the owner so passionate about his food. This is highly recommended place. Raf and his wife, Jazzy, welcomed us with a big bowl of goat and chickpea curry. The food was the best! Goat curry was succulent and flavorful! Chickpea curry was hearty and the garlic chutney was delicious! It was hearty and filled our tired souls. We were visiting Birmingham and have been traveling since the early morning.

I stayed after a busy bank holiday weekend and although clean and tidy, it felt the bed making was perhaps rushed but still nothing to be picky about.

The aircon was amazing! Some of the best and quickest to cool a room.

The bed comfortable and the shower hot (although not the most amazing pressure).

It was quiet in the hotel and breakfast is down in the attached restaurant which I’ve reviewed separately. Stopped in just to get a breakfast as was staying in a TL and theirs aren't as good but cost almost as much. The staff were friendly and efficient. Food was excellent. Everything cooked perfectly, fully stocked, and being regularly refilled with fresh. Both scrambled and fried eggs cooked perfectly. Decent unlimited coffee. Plus I think you can have up to two kids free with an adult so potentially less than £4 per person. This was the first time me and my daughter stayed here, we were welcome on entry the room was lovely spacious even doe we've had much bigger at other premier inns. The room service was good the food from restaurant was beautiful only problem was there wasn't much on the menu when we stayed. Breakfast was nice but we wished there was more even doe one of the waitress went out of her way to get yoghurts for my daughter, which was most appreciated. All the staff were great and the location was good too all and all we had a good stay The staff are very friendly and helpful. The room I had was really quiet and very clean. There was ample tea, coffee and milk in the room and plenty more if required in the reception area. The resturant for breakfast was excellent, plenty of cereals, breads and the cooked breakfast smelled lovely (I didn't have that). It is nice that in the evening you can get a drink and the surroundings are favourable for relaxing with nice lighting. Stayed here for the first time while in Birmingham. I had read previous reviews and took with a pinch of salt.
The room was absolutely beautiful for standard. Wasn't that bothered about the view since the curtains would be closed anyway!
Food in the attached restaurant was top quality and definitely value for money. For £30, it includes unlimited breakfast and a evening meal deal comprising of either starter and main OR main and dessert. I chose starter (beef burnt ends) and main (8oz rump with chips) and includes a drink. WOW!

At £100+ for a single room, do yourself a favour and stay in the Travelodge around the corner instead. I believe that the hotel staff—including not only the cleaners, but also the housekeeping supervisor and the manager—need proper training. Just because a hotel is in a lower price category, it doesn’t mean that the room should be handed over to a new guest in a dirty condition.

In the bathroom, the shower cabin had water spots, it hadn’t been cleaned or sprayed with cleaning products. The shower head and the tap were also covered in water spots and limescale, and the mirror was spotty too. There were black hairs in the shower cabin (and I have blonde hair, so they definitely weren’t mine).

When I lifted the toilet seat, there were urine stains underneath. The cupboard was covered in a thick layer of dust—not just a few days’ worth, but clearly much older.

The attached photos and videos speak for themselves. The room was big. That's all. There was no body wash. Only 1 small towel and one medium size towel. The hand wash was 2 tiny squeezable plastic tubes. I didn't book it and will not stay there again. The TV was constantly updating.  Its not for me. Sorry but I won't pretend each to their own. I always bring my own provisions . I wish I could give zero star to this hotel. They are total scam so plz stay away from this. Pictures advertised are fake and you will be disappointed by the filthy rooms and poor service. They offered us a room with no window ( temperature outside was around 30 degrees) which I refused on the spot. They gave us another room which was on 8th floor. It was so hot and had to keep windows open so could hear everything from outside. I couldnt sleep even a single night as have to keep the windows open. When asked for a fan they flately refused. Stay away at all costs The room and hotel is outdated and very basic. It’s ok if you just using it as a place to crash for a night, I checked in at 9pm and checked out before 9am.

What a find. It’s not cheap, but that’s reflected in the location, venue, presentation of food and taste. And goodness, everything was delicious! We were a party of 6; our order consisted of the Medicine and various French toasts.

The only gripe is the fried chicken from one plate to another varied quite a bit in size. We don’t know whether one was more generous, or we were short changed on the other? A bit of consistency here wouldn’t go amiss.

Other than that, a perfect way to start a Sunday morning. They also allowed dogs too! Service was timely, the venue was beautiful with lots of plants, and everyone of us enjoyed our meal.
Can’t wait to come back. Well done! The Medicine Bakery is a staple for those who brunch in Brum. The food is excellent. Well priced. Generous portions and overall delicious.

From street level up the stairs you are greeted with a take away counter for loads of baked treat and bread which look and smell amazing.

You then have a small hallway with bench seating where the coffee are made which did get a little congested as it’s so popular. We did book which I thoroughly recommend to not have to wait for a table.

The dining room is large. Bright and airy with high ceilings, loads of green succulents and gallery walls.  Current exhibition is a photography collection of black culture in the UK. Lots of bench style seating down the middle which means you may share the bench with others (something which never bothers me)

The service speed is what lets the venue down. The coffee is excellent but always takes a long time to come. This has been a consistent issue with all my visits. The food is delicious. Beautifully cooked and seasoned. Though offering black pepper from a mill and not powered would be expected in a place like this.

Overall it’s great with slightly nonchalant service. Book ahead and make sure you have a hearty appetite. First time here for breakfast .
Very smart place in the mailbox Birmingham.
Menu good with lots of lovely choices.
My choice-sausage brioche with a side of hash brown. Very tasty. 😁

Medicine is by far my favourite place for brunch in birmingham, the food is gorgeous and made with high quality ingredients. Presented beautifully and with really well-balanced flavours.

The location itself is wonderful, going through a hole in the wall in the murky town centre is a bright sun-light filled room with art and greenery. A super welcoming change to the streets.

The coffee is okay- not fantastic but the sweet treats are fabulous as to be expected. Definitely a spot worth hitting up if you’re in birmingham. Truly a gem in the rough. Service can be quite slow and inconsistent but it’s understandably very popular and busy during weekend lunchtimes. The food definitely is worth the wait and the fair prices.

The harissa eggs benedict changed my life and the medicine is gorgeous too. Our first time eating in here (had take out a few times) and it was a mixed bag. We waited 16 mins for someone to take our order despite asking twice . The food came quickly and was delicious (maybe a savong grace). When it came to the bill we had to ask twice before someone sorted it.

I admit to not knowing my Schloer from my Bolinger. So what attracted me to Loki Wine & Deli? It was the bright lights of its humble deli counter and the promise of mince pies. At the small deli counter I could see the beautiful, yet straightforward, range of cheeses, hams and antipastos. These are more to complement the wines than a meal outright.
The wine is elegantly presented on its many wooden shelves around the perimeter of the shop. The wooden standing platform on the left hand side of the shop was well lit, displaying the more audacious drink varieties. There are a few tables to sit down and relax in the company of groups and grapes.

Dear Subway Team,

I am writing to share my recent experience at your store on 7th July around 8:00 PM. The store was quiet at the time, with only two or three other customers present. My wife and I had initially planned to dine in. While she was seated, a staff member wearing a black uniform approached us and asked her to change her seat in a very rude and unprofessional manner.

We found this behavior extremely disappointing and chose to leave and dine elsewhere. I still decided to use my Subway points to purchase water bottles, but the same staff member refused this as well, which added to our frustration.

I believe the individual in the black uniform might be the manager. If that is the case, I am genuinely concerned about how someone with such poor customer service skills is leading the team. Respectful and courteous behavior should be a priority, especially from management.

I hope this feedback is taken seriously, and the staff member is advised to treat customers with basic respect and professionalism in the future.

Thank you for your time and understanding. The woman was the most vile person ever ! Usually I order online and this was my first time going in person . She had no patience and was speaking and directing conversation to my partner rather than myself who was ordering the food . I was getting confused and she lacked any empathy. We were the only ones in the shop so it’s not like she didn’t have time to be able to be patient. Completely has put me off from ever going into a subway . No customer service at all . And when another member arrived she started speaking to her in another language and you could just tell they were speaking about us I came into the Broadway Plaza store first time. I asked for Potato Waffle fries. Omg it's the worst ever. Stale tasting and too soft. It was very horrible. Plus cookies are so expensive compared to other branches- £6 for 6 cookies! Come to Manchester guys, £4.19 for 12 cookies. AVOID!!!

Man who works there overcharges people and gets the order wrong.

No point complaining as a franchise owner does NOT respond to complaints.

Thank you Sohail for robbing me bear face and then refusing to respond to my complaint email despite a reciept being provided as evidence.

All reviews state they overprice there customers so its definitely a regular scheme they adopt to, disgusting behaviour. If I could rate this 0 stars I would. Ordered a Footlong sub with all the salad and meatballs which came to £14. On arrival, I opened it to find a squashed, burnt sub with 1 piece of lettuce, 2 pieces of sweetcorn, 2 olives, 2 cucumbers, a piece of pepper, no crispy onions, and the crappiest sprinkle of cheese you’ve ever seen. The meatballs were stone cold. The delivery was prompt and only took 30 mins from ordering to unwrapping so they couldn’t have gone cold in that time. I just can’t believe people can serve this and expect their customers to be happy.

I called up the shop as I couldn’t get a refund through UberEats (very difficult process) and a lady answered, listened to my problem then hung up on me. I called back several times, no answer. Eventually leaving it a while and calling back, someone answers. I speak to another lady who says that they always do it properly so next time ask for extra salad! My problem wasn’t the extra salad, it was just having salad in the first place!

They then tried to blame UberEats saying it was their fault. I said “but you make the food?” and they replied “yes, but we do it properly so don’t know what’s happened”. They then tried to blame them for the temperature of meatballs saying they must have gone cold during delivery.

I’m just amazed that food industries as big as Subway can get away with charging £10 for a sandwich and supplying something that’s inedible. I’m appalled at the service and the ignorance towards customers. Working in the industry myself, I wouldn’t dare serve food I wouldn’t want to eat myself and surely wouldn’t speak to customers the way I was spoken to.

A long Buffet table with vegetables and salads for your self-service . And many meat skewers are brought by servants .

Brazilian grill is a simple concept - turn your card on the green side if you want meat served to you, and red if you want a break. It’s an interactive experience as meat is served straight from the kitchen and cut in front of you.
Good variety of meat served, I personally enjoyed the lamb chops, chicken legs best. Rump is the best beef out of all, whilst the others can be a bit tough. There’s also a large variety of sides & salad bar, quality is so-so and could be kept warmer.

We has no reservation but were seated swiftly. They explained to us how we order which is online through a barcode. We ordered and the food came out within 30minutes. The food was great, filling and definitely to our standards. It's hard to go wrong with Pizza Hut, and this place was no exception. Truly exceptional service from the gentleman working front of house this evening (Lyndon). The food was fresh and hot and really tasty. Exactly what was needed. Visited during the half-term holidays for the all-in lunchtime buffet. It was absolutely crowded out, and I discovered why afterwards. They had a deal on for a free kids meal if you spend £10 or more. I hadn't seen this so I paid full price, which is my own mistake! It's a cashless venue, and you have to order off the QR code, or at least that's what I was told to do anyway.

I was very happy with the buffet as all of it was non-haallal so all options were fine for me. A decent selection of pizza varieties, my personal favourite was the 'nduja one. They do serve beer and wine but I stuck to the soft drink machine as it was included in the buffet. All of the staff were lovely, it's just how busy the place was and the queues where quite overwhelming, as well as lots of little kids running freely and popping up over our booth.

If you're a vegetarian, I'd exercise caution as I did see a child swap a ham pizza into the vegetarian section so although the best care is taken by the restaurant in the way they've set it up, they can't keep an eye on everyone during hectic times. We had such great service. Abi, Tom and Sasha were amazing and very attentive. They even added a smiley face in our pizza :) Me and my mum went in for lunch and we had a lovely experience. The staff (Tom, Lyndon & Lisa) were extremely friendly and helpful with us. The food came and was fresh and warm and we had no issues. The venue was clean and fresh. We always pick this one to the New Street Branch as the staff are more welcoming and food is much more fresher than that at New Street.

We however gave it a second chance and went back and it was even worse the second time. The lady didn't understand my mum's order; egg sandwich, no cheese. The lady replied 'we have no sausage'. So my mum said her order over and over, I even said my mum's order too. We then pointed to the menu and said 'third one down without the cheese' and again the reply was 'we have no sausage'.

The location was excellent, and the customer service was exceptional. The receptionist, Cristina, was especially lovely she helped us order a taxi she was very helpful and welcoming.  we had a fantastic stay overall.🥳🥳🥳 I can’t fault this place, Premier suites should be very proud of their staff Svitlana, Paulina and the other ladies, they are always very welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. The cleaners and the maintenance guy are always friendly. Clean very comfortable accommodation with great WiFi which you can rely on if you need it for work. Ideal location very central. Svitlana and team I can’t thank you enough for putting up with my last minute requests it helps me so much and means I can be flexible with my work schedule and clients. I had very enjoyable stay at premier suites Birmingham. Pauline at reception desk was very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended! Will be back soon Have just come back from a weekend in the Birmingham suites. There is nothing premier about this accommodation.

Little things in here just didn’t make sense, an apartment that sleeps 4, yet the kettle only holds enough water to make 2 cups of teas/coffee and a toaster that makes 2 slices of toast, also there was only 1 sofa that has enough room for 2 people, the room was big enough to fit another, its little things like this that made our stay not as good as it could have been.

We Booked a 2 bed apartment for 4 of us, one of us had a bath, then we ran out of hot water and after an hour still no hot water.
We called the emergency number and to be fair they sorted us out 2, 1 bed apartments and said we could keep all of them if we just wanted to use to shower, we think the apartment the hot water ran out of the boiler was on a timer, except it was in a locked cupboard, the other apartments, you had access to this.
The 2nd apartment we were in the fuse ring that all the plug sockets and the boiler was on tripped our last morning and wouldn’t go back, so no hot water or plugs so had to back to the old apartment for this.
The first apartment the rooms didn’t smell very clean and the 2nd apartment we were in stunk of cigarettes, the rooms are clean, just not very well maintained.
The positives, our issues with water etc were sorted quickly and location was very good, wouldn’t stay here again",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

They didn't have any accessible rooms listed on their website but they upgraded us to an accessible room when our room's TV wouldn't work! Wheelchair accessibility was pretty good. Loved the inclusion of a pull cord by the bed in the accessible room! The cleaners added a lovely personal touch! Great location.
Large room with a super king bed. Great shower.
The only downsides were the pillows weren't the most comfortable but were ok.
Perfect location (opposite New St station) and close to many bars and restaurants etc. However, just outside of the hotel was really run down and derelict.

The air con didn't work (wouldn't even turn on). When I informed reception, they said they'd try and fix it during the day, and that if they couldn't, then they'd move me to a different room. They didn't fix it and told me I couldn't move rooms as most of the rooms didn't have air conditioning working either. Poor for a large chain hotel (especially due to the fact it was the hottest days of the year so far). So uncomfortable to sleep. Brilliant location, easy to taxis around the city, right in the centre and close to everything.

Staff were spot, everything was just sorted out easy and efficient.

Hotel has 3 Eva charges which would have been good except you can’t reserve but 1 was reserved and another had a non EV parked in it. Not the end of the world as there are plenty of chargers around and the NCP is right opposite the rear entrance.

Room was ok, was really hot and the fan didn’t do much to cool us down. But everything was there, we just needed a base to crash for the night

Does a job!! Very disappointing experience – avoid during hot weather

I specifically booked this hotel because it advertised having air conditioning, and with the recent heat, I wanted a comfortable stay. Unfortunately, the air conditioner in my room didn’t work at all. What made things worse is that the hotel did not inform me about this at check-in.

When I raised the issue, the receptionist told me they were fully booked and couldn’t move me to another room. She offered me breakfast or a drink instead – which I declined – but this felt like a poor attempt to make up for such a serious comfort issue, especially in peak summer heat.

What’s most frustrating is that I later checked Google reviews and saw someone else had the exact same issue a week before my stay. Clearly, this is an ongoing problem, and they continue to check guests into rooms knowing the air conditioning doesn’t work. This is highly unprofessional and misleading. If the AC is broken, these rooms should not be in use.

I expected more from a large hotel chain. Sadly, I wouldn’t recommend this place – at least not until they fix their air conditioning and improve how they handle guest concerns. Great place to stay! Clean, modern spacious rooms, next door to the train station, which made me worried it might be noisy at night but have been proved worring for nothing. Had a good rest at night. Close to city centre. Lovely breakfast!

The staff are incredibly helpful, and the restaurant is spotless and well-maintained.

The menu boasts a wide variety of choices, catering to different tastes. I tried the fusion burger, which was absolutely delicious, though I found the portion a bit small as I finished it quite quickly.

This place is highly recommended, especially for families, thanks to its friendly environment. The only downside is the location—it’s tucked away in the city centre with limited free parking, which might be inconvenient for those coming from outside the area. However, it’s a great spot for students living nearby.

Overall, a solid choice for a tasty burger experience. One of the best spots in town for burgers and pizzas. Their stone-baked pizzas are unique and one of their kind in all of Birmingham. Definitely recommend to try this place. Ordered a burger meal with curly fries, the food was nice, but the portions are really small for what you are paying. Unfortunately I left still wanting more food. Should increase the size of portions. Also would be good if they did grilled chicken with rice. Ordered a beef pizza and chicken grilled burger. It was nice but the chicken was such a tiny slice of breast it wasn't even a full breast which was really disappointing and the fries weren't the best at all, a bit dry. The shop looks nice and clean, the owner could be a bit more polite towards customers. We asked the guy aswell to have whatever is ready first either the burgers or the pizza he said ok but in the end he decided to leave the burgers sitting there rather then give them to us first as asked and agreed to and then the pizza “Absolutely bangin’ chicken burger from Box BBQ!”

Nipped in for a quick bite and wow — didn’t expect the burger to be this good! The chicken’s proper juicy with a nice crispy coating, and the sauce they’ve slapped on? Mad flavour. Bit of a kick but not over the top. You’ve got your fresh lettuce, tangy pickles, red onions — all tucked into a soft, slightly toasted bun. Every bite’s got a bit of everything goin’ on.

Honestly, didn’t leave a single crumb. If you’re after a solid chicken burger in town, this one’s a winner.

We always stay here if we have a show and the menu has just changed and it’s definitely worth a visit. Came here with my family and had to leave. The staff was extremely difficult and awkward to get a straight answer out of. When we turned up there were only two other tables but ended up having to wait about 40 minutes. I ordered a kids meal and it came with crisps but supposedly this took about 20 minutes to prepare, which I had to ask for as they had forgotten. We were given dirty knives and forks and when ask for a replacement they handed us they while touching the ends with their hands. We finally had to push them again were our food was and they brought out a undercooked frozen pizza. The base was soggy underneath and honestly the cheap ones from Aldi taste nicer than this. We could eat the food even though we were starving, ended up leaving as this was a poor excuse for an evening meal. If you're staying in the hotel, the breakfast was okay, I only had this as it was already paid for but honestly if you can avoid coming here please do so. Service was a little slow in the restaurant.

Week day very nice time to go.
Not many people inside so the staff can bring a good service.

No paper waste so you have to be ready for the number in your screen you will need to collect your order.

And if you have the app you will allow to scan your code for have app promotion to redeem in the restaurant.

The place was clean so you can eat without thinking that you will sick.

Kids are very welcome and obviously they will love the fries.

I had whopper (of course) because are the best fast food burgers. This Burger King was in a very handy location, as it was just around the corner from the Travelodge I was at, which didn't have as far as I could see a place to have breakfast in. Very useful location. Me and 2 others visited here for whopper day! Two of us had the plant-base whopper which might be one of the best veg burgers we have ever had. Even my non-vegetarian friends preferred the plant based whopper. Revisiting,  2 years on.

A massive improvement and change from what it once was, the burgers are now fully cooked, fresh and fast, the location itself provides itself a nice central placement in the bull ring - this allows a get away from the chaos of what is going on outside.

Tables are often kept neat and tidy, with the staff putting in a world of effort to ensure consistent and high quality is being delivered.

The burgers taste standard for burger king, which is a good thing, they are well cooked and consistently delivered at high level, all customisations are adhered to.

Located close to the burger king is a car park that charges £2 for parking.

Although the machines are still placed in an odd location, the tables set around the restaurant have been moved slightly and now make more logical sense, beyond this, the upper level of the restaurant seems to have been permenately closed.

There is disability access available.

This is vastly different from the burger kind I made a visit to a while ago, same brand, same staff, but new vibe and a strong positive energy; a lot of respect as this is often hard for a branch to do.

Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area and want a quick bite. The food my mom ordered, it looks really good, the burger has the big flavours and the fries with bbq dip is so delicious, the shake was tasty, will order again if possible and necessary. 🤤🤤🤤",1.0,0.0,"[""Burger"", ""Cafe"", ""Fast Food"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Breakfast""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Portion Size""]"

But honestly, this was the worst shawarma I’ve ever had.
Tried both the chicken and lamb, and unfortunately, neither had good flavor or freshness.
Even simple street cart shawarmas have been far better than this. Really disappointed. Chicken shwarma with rice is the best in town !!

Staff were very attentive and well presented. The Cosy Club is beautiful inside and an ideal place for breakfast or lunch. The best fish fingers in a brioche bun I've had in a while.
Prices reasonable, staff lovely.
Busy on a Saturday afternoon at Easter.
Love the decor and ambience of Cosy Clubs.
Bit of a trek to the ladies toilets down a long flight of stairs is the one downside, but one disabled/baby changing toilet is available on the the ground floor. Beautiful building. Prices expensive but to be expected with a cosy club. Bar staff were lovely and even offered me a free drink upon an incident with my drink. Would highly recommend but be aware of the prices I'm definitely more of a pancake and waffles girl, I could eat waffles with almost anything, that’s how much I love them. So, discovering a great pancake spot is always exciting.

The pancake at The Cosy Club was fluffy, filling, and just right. The bacon was cooked to perfection, and the extra avocado topping was the right amount. Yum, yum, yum!
It’s located in the city center, so parking can be tricky. I recommend using the Snowhill Station parking and taking a short 5-minute walk.

The staff were super friendly, and I even had a nice chat with the manager about plans for Shrove Tuesday (Pancake Day). They don’t have anything set up yet, but she suggested I keep an eye on their social media for any updates.

I did notice one diner swearing, and I think it might be worth the restaurant considering  a clear policy or a watershed approach could help maintain the atmosphere for everyone. Was welcomed despite not booking when it as busy with large groups for Christmas lunches. Sharing plates delicious. Had the most beautiful clementine margarita.

Ladies toilets are a little to be desired but it was the end of the night and it had been busy, cant blame it on the staff.

Will definitely be back. My first time in Missing in Gay Village and I had a ball.

Huge shout out to 'TWIGGY' you looked to die for ♡ Brilliant night in here, all great bar staff, Benjamin such a nice friendly lad always sociable and he makes you feel welcome al the time. Wow what a flipping amazing safe bar to be in during pride all the staff are amazing and dunno how they remembered my drink all time, the drag artists are amazing. I was so Welcomed by the staff and the locals, definitely be going to missing again. I went to pride but spent most of my time in missing bar until early hrs #wheelchairguy #carlingblack Always a great time had at missing.  The staff from door to Dj are always very friendly and welcoming.  Had a great time in and out during Pride.

Thank you! The bar itself is kind of a letdown, I've been coming to the gay district for the past few weeks and I start the night at Missing. I could write a story but in short:

Negatives;
- The drinks are over priced, for reference a small wkd is like £4/5 ish and £1 more than in sidewalk which is 100 feet away.
- The vast majority of staff just sort of stand around killing time not looking at the bar
- They don't cut people off so there's the odd mega drunk walking around
- Seating wise you don't have much of an option unless it's outside or a small area completely out of view from the stage/dance area
- The upstairs smoking area looks like a back alley
- In terms of cleanliness the toilets are cleaner than some area

Positives so far:
- They have really good drag acts
- The bouncers that I've talked to are friendly
- A few of the staff don't hate their job

Overall and this is coming from someone brand new to the gay scene and 30, missing is the type of bar where you either go out as a group of like 4 or more and dance or get absolutely wasted, if you don't fit in to that category you're going to have a meh time.

It's the type of pub where you start your night off and go alright I've had a drink here let's go to sidewalk or eden",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Booking/Entry""]"

The prepayment system is easy to use, and the staff helped us to have a card and top it up. There are different eateries with Korian, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Chinese food. The concept is perfect, the staff is friendly, the food is tasty, and we had massive portions. I will definitely visit when I visit Birmingham next time. An intriguing concept where if you can’t pay by cash, you have to buy a payment card, to buy food and drinks, understandably with card costs incurred to the restaurants. My friend and I went Japanese and I went for the eel, and wow, fantastic fresh food produced quicker than a fast food chain can stop chatting and finally hand you a pathetic looking burger. The food was amazing and more than I could eat for what I thought would be a light lunch. Great Asian style space for small businesses to deliver high quality Michelin restaurant style food quickly, professionally and respectfully, go try it, if you like Asian food, you will not be disappointed. This food hall is such a gem! There are so many food options to choose from — perfect for when you're with friends and everyone wants something different! I tried the Thai food on the 2nd floor, and it was absolutely amazing. It honestly felt like a taste of home. I had the Tom Yum noodle, and wow — the flavor was spot on and the spiciness was just right! 🌶️🍜 A real comfort dish that I’ll definitely come back for.

Another great spot is Sakura — I ordered the bento box, and the portion was huge! You really get your money’s worth, and it left me feeling full and happy. 🍱

On the flip side, the Korean food stall didn’t quite meet expectations. The wait was much longer compared to the others, and when the food finally arrived, it was quite bland. The portion was also pretty small, which was disappointing. 😕

Still, overall, this food hall is a fantastic place to visit with lots of delicious options. Bee Thai Food is a must-try if you're a fan of bold, authentic Thai flavors! Highly recommend! ✨❤️ A market style food hall. Basically pop up shops with Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Thai food.
You have to purchase a charge card and then use that to pay. If you pay cash, you get any refund back, but if you nominate to pay by card then there is no refund.

I prefer the Japanese as I love my Sushi. It was really good. Reasonable prices and generous portions.

The beauty is you can choose whatever everyone wants and not restricted.

Plenty to choose from which is what will make you keep going back.

The places is slightly out of the way from most of the china town restaurant and up upstairs. Beautiful food and good value, the portions were massive, we went to the second floor where the Japanese and Korean stall was.
The only thing is that you must top up a card instead of paying the vendors directly. You can get a “card” to put money on with either cash or card but if you do it by card then you cannot top it up again unless the transaction is over £5 ( I believe this sign should have been ON THE INSTRUCTIONS/GUIDANCE )
If you have money left over on the card you will not be refunded your £2 deposit for the card they’ve given you…

I have no words for how incredible the roast was and their Cajun main menu looks just as good - an incredible addition to Birmingham’s independent food scene!

If you like food that’s well seasoned, comforting and full of flavour then you need to come here The new Caribbean food they do was good value and aurhentic with good portion sizes. Pub is nicely decorated inside. Would visit again. The food was great, but our orders came out wrong and the person who served us insisted it wasn’t wrong and said ‘I know it’s correct as I put the order through, I’m walking away now’ (we had a list of what we’d ordered and cross checked but the server insisted they were correct). The missing meal arrived much later.

The sides and starters all arrived way after our main meals, we ordered salt fish and was given corn fritters because they’d ran out, and our dumplings never arrived, we didn’t get any of the missing or incorrect items refunded, the mac and cheese and plantain arrived ages after all our mains had been eaten, we were planning to eat it all together.

We were a big table and I understand the order was large and I have experience working in food so I know how high stress it can be, so I do understand, however no apology was given and the large delays were not communicated effectively, a lot of this could’ve been resolved with clear communication instead of hostility and lack of accountability.

Unfortunately the service and lack of organisation really let things down, had this side of things been better I would have 100% been a repeat customer as the food was nice! It was also my family members birthday meal so it’s a shame things weren’t up to scratch. I went here with my teenage son for a Sunday roast.  The food was delicious and the service was good.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  The vibe in the place is good.

Looking for some advice on makeup for a up coming wedding. I was lucky in meeting two absolutely amazing young ladies shay and Jay. The level of professionalism and attention shown was amazing. They are both a credit to the company and will no doubt go very far in life. Thank you both for a wonderful experience.
Extremely happy customer. I went to Aveda for my Scalp and hair analysis. The girl over there treated me so well. Checked my scalp and suggested me Scalp solution range which really helped me. I was quite happy with the service and her recommendation. Well trained and knowledgeable staff
Thanks Boots x I have been to this Boots many times, and I am usually very disappointed by the stock levels and in particular the amount of tester products available. Usually when I go to the makeup stands, I cannot try the products I want to as there are no testers available, and there are also only a few products available to buy. Often a few shelves are fully empty.
The queue time is also often very long, and there are often not many staff on the till, considering it is a busy shop. I have actually known the queue to get very long, but there still be no staff at all at the till point. (See photo for part of a queue on such an occasion).
It may seem strange that this largely negative review is attached to a 3-star review, however I must give credit to the lovely team members at the store, to the pharmacy staff for always being so helpful, for the well stocked pharmacy shelves and to the people who have given me vaccinations at the store in the past. I just want to raise the two big issues I have with the store, as they so often frustrate me! Store is too hot you in the day you need to put something on the Back Windows to block the sun out. Even use A/C went in today absolutely awful in here. Wanted to buy more but couldn’t possible stay any longer or even concentrate on what I was buying. The attitude of the staff at the front of the shop (make up skin care area) really stinks, ignorant and just straight up rude! Unacceptable! I understand it's hard to work in retail, and it's a very hot day with a lot people but the staff single handedly turned what was a misunderstanding situation into a escalated conflicts! As customer, I feel misjudged and discriminate and I don't feel valued or looked after. So I tried to ask for help as I shop for products but not only the female staff was ignoring me cuz she was speaking with the security by the door, but she was also not helpful at all, I picked up a bundle box at ordinary display but the products display was misplaced and it was not actually whats inside the box behind it and i was super confused and all three boxs of the ordinary bundle were worn out and shows signs of been opened by someone and as i was inspecting and called her over for help, the staff she immediately came over and accused me of opening the box but I didnt even open it fully i was just checking if its the right content cuz all the bundle box has been already opened by someone and I was just checking cuz I was buying it! and after I pointed out it's looks abit worn and the product placement was confusing she then handed me another box but it was extremely worn out box with yellow stains on it, it's giving the impression she was trying to sell me inferior products and i bet she wouldn't even buy it herself seen that, and i said no and she immediately started pulling off that attitude as if I have to buy that (the products thats opened by other people already) and she didnt even help me to get the product I wanted ! And I told her what I actually wanted and she was like oh its somewhere else and the other staff came and handed me that and then the female staff immediately talked to the other staff right in front of me: ""you see, this is what I meant"" while both pulling off that stinky attitude and clearly referred to the situation, i felt extremely offended and that just straight up unprofessional and rude and unnecessary to do this in front of customers!, isn't helping customers the job ???! All of that is so unnecessary and even if I shouldn't open it to check (in that case I totally should) the way she didnt even listen and think about what on about she just decides to take piss on me. I am very disappointed.

We had chicken Kotthu, Paneer Masala well cooked to perfection.

Worth visiting and giving it a try. For me this restaurant is a 10/10 place for Indian food. Super fresh crispy Naan Bread (Naan Bread of my Life so far).

Service is top, Nice background music playing nice ambiente. Amazing food at Celebrity Restaurant! The Paneer Shashlik and Naga Wings were flavorful starters.

I would love to come here again when I come to Birmingham. First of all let me start writing about how disgusting the food was and the service was sooo bad, i will never in my dreams visit this place again because they have to hire someone there who knows how to cook.
So we ordered chicken biryani and oh god i had a bite of it and i felt like i was gonna puke and it just wasn’t me, it was my cousin too who dint like it. And the service was sooo bad bad cause i asked him for water glasses and the guy said drink it from the wine glass cause the restaurants busy and he cant bring the water glasses and later someone else bought the water glass and the food no taste and i would probably cook far more better than that, i would not even pay a pound for that food what they made and the audacity to add the service charge after being so ridiculous is what got onto my nerve so a big no and fire the chef who made it and the glass guy",0.8,0.2,"[""Indian"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Portion Size"", ""Sound/Noise""]"

I really enjoyed it. The food was of good authentic quality with plenty to try and at reasonable prices too. Note that the menu online is out of date so they should update that. Drinks prices also very reasonable. Service could have been a little more organised and friendlier. Toilets were clean but they have a gap in the ceiling above for both genders so you can hear each other from the cubicles which I found weird. Overall we would visit again First time I ever went there to buy food, they tried robbing me off my money by including something I never ordered in my bill and they kept the receipt . And when I realised after paying over £20 for something I never ordered. They claimed it was a mistake and promised to refund me. They went further to ask for my account number. Thereafter, many days passed by without them refunding me , I kept calling and the manager kept frustrating me and refusing to transfer back my money.  Honestly, I was very disappointed in them. How could a restaurant play that kind of game with a customer. They thought I won’t be clever enough to ask for my receipt to see what I have paid for. Awesome west African food, been there a couple of times for takeaway meals and I have to say I will definitely go again! Portions are generous and tasty, cooked with fresh ingredients. I recommend the suya and the Ndole as they are my favourites. Assorted meat pepper soup is fantastic too full of fragrant flavours. Staff is really nice and helpful always get things right. A hidden gem in Birmingham! I ordered a simple chicken and rice meal with fried dumplings to take away  the order was ready after an hour and twenty minutes. I wouldn't have minded waiting if they were busy but there were only six people in the establishment and no one else was eating.

When I got the food home which is literally across the road, the rice was in a carton of grease and was not joloff rice which I ordered. When I cut into the oddly shaped pieces of chicken the meat was red at the bone and uncooked thoroughly.

I would not recommend and I will certainly never be going back.

My favorite is the Chicken Teriyaki or the Veggie Delight with extra cheese and chipotle southwest sauce—highly recommend it toasted! It’s also a great option if you’re trying to eat a bit healthier without sacrificing flavor.

Clean environment, quick service, and reliable taste. Can’t go wrong with Subway!

Although the shop may cost a few pennies more, the coffee is better quality, better taste & is fresher.
My review:
Soon as you walk in Costa Coffees doors, it’s clean, pristine & pleasant smelling. It will either be almost empty or it’ll be where you can hardly find a seat - depending whether it’s peak times or not. Try to avoid going at peak times/rush hour (like when JQ offices/shops close for the day around 4-5pm). It has a warm, casual, calm vibe. Not like the City Centre chaos of ‘keep your handbag close’ type energy. Store is large, bright and welcoming. There’s usually 1-2 members of staff on so you’re served pretty quickly. (Ensure you scan your Costa Card & get those beans & free drinks!) Menu is high up and easily readable. Ask if you’re not sure/want something custom. It’s their job to assist you & you’re paying so don’t feel shy. Much more menu choices than the Express machines. Regular promotional items come & go (which I love) but they don’t last forever so get them quick! Usually a courteous manner from staff, prompt speed for serving you your drink, served without spillages, lid tight & my custom requests are honoured. Condiments area near to counter, it’s clean & well stocked with all items labelled clearly. This is usually where notices are regarding allergens, recycling info & store info; as well as the bin which I’ve never seen full or overflowing. Lots of seating but I chose to leave with my drinks every time. Big windows to view out of to see Frederick St (retail units, Car Paks complex, Chamberlain Clock & the mini roundabout it’s on) Parking is available right outside, 3-4 spots. This is free after 6pm to 8am & all Sunday, otherwise around £1.50. Pay at machine or RingGo app. Same nearby (Eg Warstone La & Vyse St). There’s Vyse St Multi Storey car park 2min walk away adj to the P.O. It’s technically the same road, just named different as it’s over the mini roundabout. Pricing is about the same & pay the same ways. Best to pay on the App as you can easily extend, not have to worry about finding change nor risk a ticket. I’ve never checked if there’s toilet facilities. I wouldn’t advise making reservations/pre ordering for collection unless it’s a very large order. You’re just going to get cold drinks. Although I’d say it’s kid friendly, it’s not a place for kids (it’s a place for coffee drinkers - which are 100% adults). So unless you have super young babies who just sleep 99% of the time in a pram/holster, very well behaved children or you’re only in for a collection therefore short periods eg - I wouldn’t advise bringing in kids. It’s a place that serves scolding hot liquids that customers set down on tables…. I don’t think you’d want your child/children running around that. Not the place. Pricing is much better than Starbucks by far, & slightly better than Tim Hortons. Prices are not as good as McD’s but DEFINITELY miles better than their quality. Service here meets Costa’s standards overall. I’ve seen better service for Costa in other locations but it’s not bad at all. Wheelchair/scooter friendly as no steps outside, it’s a flat ramp only. They also offer alternatives to dietary requirements. Giving 4/5 for service as I have been left waiting a few times when it’s been empty yet staff finish cleaning up/tending to coffee machines behind the counter/tables etc while I’m at the counter waiting to order. Nothing serious but after 2 minutes, it’s a little rude. Otherwise an excellent branch that no doubt sees 1000’s of customers per week in such a popular area like JQ. Yet still manages to maintain Google star rating of nearly 5. I will be returning to this branch. Recommended Stopped here for tea, coffee and cakes on a wet Monday morning. Service was polite and efficient. The 'raspberry and almond bake' was delicious - but rather small for the £2.85 price tag. And 25p dearer than at my local Costa!! Visited this costa for a drink with friends. The service was very quick and staff were polite. Plenty of choice of different seating areas, however the air-con was quite strong on a fairly cool day, meaning the seating areas around this were uncomfortably cold, so we had to move to another table. I went to this Jewellery Quarter branch of Costa. It's nice and spacious with having plenty of seatings. There are spaces by the wide windows to choose from if you want to seat and get some day lights. One thing which was really annoying the very loudly noises of café machine. Despite we were seating far away from the counter right by the window, but the café grinding machine completely disturbed our conversation and we had to wait again and again for the machine to stop so we can continue to our conversation. Finally had no choice but to leave the place. Btw, before leaving I thanked the two members of staff. I don't think I would try this branch again, unless I'm desperate.

I have always found the care home staff to be very welcoming and friendly.   A very clean, caring environment and everybody appears to be well looked after.  I would be most happy to recommend this care home to anybody. Celia, my Mother, started living in this fabulous care home a few months ago and couldn’t be happier.
She has been cared for in every way possible and is thriving for it. The staff, especially Zsungai and Ethel,  are constantly attentive to her needs.
She has established solid friendships with the other residents, which is a real bonus. She went into the home weighing only six stone, having been extremely unwell and in hospital for several weeks with a serious stomach issue.
The change in my Mum is remarkable, so thank you too to Rebecca who looks after my Mum’s diet.
Thank you.
Helena Nesbitt amd the rest of the family. This morning I have had the pleasure of attending Edgbaston Beaumont in a professional capacity. It has been a pleasure meeting the homes general manager Sarah and her staff, I can not praise ALL the staff highly enough for the care and dedication they give to their residents is second to none. All the staff are friendly and very knowledgeable about their residents. I could not fault anything about this home. I base this on many homes I visit in my average working day. Having Visited for Edgbaston Beaumont for many years I always have found myself welcomed with pleasant and friendly staff. Nothing is ever to much trouble for the staff at the care home. Residents are cared for well, whenever I have been there. When a resident has a concern or a worry staff are quick to assist and help in anyway they can. I attended Edgbaston Beaumont Care Home to carry out educational training. When I arrived, I was made to feel welcome straight away. The Care Home is very well presented, hidden behind beautiful gardens that the rooms over look. All of the staff were very engaging and focused on quality of care first when discussing best practise. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and I would personally like to thank the manager Debi for her support!

The music was a tad on the loud side for me as we wanted to talk, but it was upbeat and complemented the positive vibe. Good views of the canal and plenty of outdoor seating as well as inside. Had a bottomless brunch with some friends on Saturday. The food was lovely, the cocktails flowed.... Again lovely.... But the highlight was our server Jasmin.... She was fabulous and really looked after us. The manager was also a lovely lady..... So pleased we booked for this lovely afternoon As I approached All Bar One I instantly knew I would have an amazing evening. I can say I was not disappointed. From the start the atmosphere, food, drink and service was outstanding. Joanna looked after our table and can honestly say, she made us feel welcome. The whole staff and service was the best I have had. Food! Well this was incredible, Hot, well presented and very tasty.
I will certainly be frequently visiting this venue.
Thank you Joanna for making it a well worth evening out. Popped in on a weekend lunchtime for a beer. Nice location by the canal, impressive decor, mostly great, friendly service, but I will always remember this as the place where I first broke the £8 barrier for a pint! Also, we were told the coffee machine was broken, so no flat white for the wife, who settled for a Pepsi Max. Great meal in a nice pub. We enjoyed the deal that was on, the after work squad.

The restaurant is beautiful inside very clean and minimalistic. We were welcomed by Lucy who was amazing throughout the whole dinner. She made sure we had a lovely time and was friendly and cheerful but professional at the same time.
The restaurant offers a tasting menu and plenty of drinks options including a wine pairing.
Every single dish was unique on its own way and had some amazing flavours. In addition, each dish was beautifully presented. Some of my personal favourites were the Wye valley asparagus with exmoor caviar and whey sauce, a simple dish but with some unique and delicious flavours. Another favourite was the A5 Wagyu beef with grilled chicory.
There is an option to add a cheese selection before moving onto desserts and it was absolutely worth it, some delicious British cheeses with home made crackers, apple preserve and home made malt loaf.
The desserts were absolutely beautiful and tasted incredible. The sourdough cake with rye custard and brown butter ice cream was loved by everyone on the table. The petit fours at the end were the perfect finish of an amazing dinner. The sunflower seeds macarons and freshly baked madeleines were delicious. The madeleines are baked to order and still warm when served.
We even had a chat with Ben- the chef who makes all the amazing food, he was lovely.
Overall we had an amazing experience with some beautiful food and Lucy and Ben who run the restaurant made sure we felt welcomed and provided us with amazing food and exceptional service.
Definitely recommend! The whole experience at Restaurant Folium was of an outstanding class. It’s a very small and intimate setting, with one room, a central bar/barista/service area, and a kitchen with large glass window - almost open plan.

The menu is seasonal, with different tasting courses being available depending on time of the year, and produce availability. There is no choice of courses though, but that’s standard for a tasting menu.

Without spoiling the current tasting menu too much, the cod roe starter was incredibly moreish, the custard and roast chicken course was an amazing combination, and the sous vide wagyu steak… well, no words!

Whilst Folium doesn’t have a Michelin star (yet! Surely one must be coming?) it compares incredibly well to those restaurants in the area that do, and should be included in the same category.

Highly recommended, and I’m sure I will be back. We were lucky enough to walk in and grab a table on Saturday night after a cancellation. The food was fantastic, so much attention to detail in both flavour and presentation. The cod in crab butter was a personal highlight but every dish was noteworthy. We also had the wine pairing which was thoughtfully chosen and enjoyable and very much enhanced our meal. Don’t hesitate to treat yourself to this culinary delight! Fantastic experience for my birthday. My girlfriend was kind enough to take me here to celebrate and I wasn’t disappointed. The staff were fantastic and the food was outstanding. A real feast for the eyes, nose and mouth. If you like fine dining this is fabulous. Came her for the long tasting menu and what an incredible experience it was. 15 courses of some of the best food I've ever eaten. The texture and the flavours were mind blowing. The desserts we had were better than all the Michelin star restaurants in Birmingham. The experience was brilliant and the staff were great.

Placed an order for collection, chips and chicken wings were so dry and unappetising and obviously reheated, curry sauce lumpy. Called to complain to be fair did ask if we wanted fresh food at this point I refused and returned all food back to restaurant for refund, upon return owner asked for the curry sauce back??? Did he want me to scrape it off the food? bizarre, such a shame as order from here regularly and have been a customer for years. I wont order again. I ordered from
This place for the first time and I was really impressed with their service, food quality and my overall experience.
The portion size was amazing, I had plenty of extra meat like I asked for, food arrived pipping hot and I’d definitely recommend them Tried again since reverting back to Jade House menu and it was as good as before. Will definitely be our go to Chinese takeaway again. Ribs were especially good 👍 After previously saying I wouldn't be attending this newly refurbished takeaway and menu, after they'd removed the only vegan tofu dish. I was delighted to see that they'd added it back to their menu and the food is just as delicious 😋
Also really happy that they've replaced most of the awful plastic containers, with more eco friendly ones. Well done Four seasons and thank you.

We found it bizarre that we were not let to sit at our table until after we had ordered food even though the restaurant was empty First time visiting the restaurant.
Food ordered  - Bhuna Lamb, Chiken Jalfrazi, Vegetale Biriyani, Panner curry and some Garlic Naans. The lamb and chicken was so tender and not overly spiced. the naans were freah and cooked to perfection (not doughy), in fact all dishes were excellent.
The service is also excellent where the staff are very polite.
Good lighting and decor with soft music on in the background creating a good atmosphere.
When I first saw the prices of the dishes, I thought this was a bit on the expensive side but  I have to say that the quality of food made up fo it and now feel actually the prices are fair compared to lower quality food.
I would recommend this restuarant and would visit again should i be in the area. Amazing service from Raj Miah and he made it extra special for my husbands birthday with getting him cake and candle and whisky shot on the house.

High industrial ceilings, which seem to be the fashion these days, makes it difficult for people, like me, with hearing difficulties to hear anything in a conversation.

It’s a very nice and affordable place to go out with friends in city centre. The foods always been great. The only downside is the long waiting time after being served. This place is truly a hidden gem! The service was excellent, and the atmosphere struck the perfect balance - neither too empty nor too crowded—allowing us to relax and stay for quite some time. With plenty of waitstaff, service was prompt, and tables were cleared quickly.

As for the food, we both opted for pasta dishes, and they were absolutely delicious. To top it off, we indulged in kunafa with strawberries covered in chocolate. Fair warning - if you don’t have a sweet tooth, you might want to skip it because it’s INCREDIBLY rich and indulgent!

I’d definitely return and have already recommended this spot to a few friends. Just found a little gem in the Birmingham city centre. Very delicious coffee and dessert.  Everyone  is welcomed within a big smile, and nothing is too much for the staff( very patient with children when they are placing their order). It's really affordable, especially for the number of desserts  we had. Highly recommended.   I will definitely be back there soon. First time going to this cafe, with a friend. I don’t understand why it takes so long to bring out the food considering that they aren’t even busy. Seen a few workers just having a chat. Honestly not impressed and won’t be visiting again. Had to ask tobought my food and the worker then slowly walked away. Honestly i never write reviews, but honestly i am astounded. Never in my 21 years on this earth have i ever been so unimpressed. Sort it out. Just to add they bought out the dessert before the food. Ridiculous. The cola that we ordered was also diet which was not stated on the menu.  Wrong cutlery. Cute little dessert shop tucked away in Martineau Place, with great atmosphere and cosy decor.

Got the Kinder Brookie and Karak Chai - chai was really tasty, with lovely cardamom notes. Could be served hotter, though it was a cold day. Brookie wasn't overly sweet but a little tough, think it may have dried out after being sat outside? Friend got a crepe but it was little crunchy, cooked for too long possibly.

Prices are really good, so many dessert shops overcharge but these prices were super decent. Service was quick & and friendly, and staff made us laugh.

Definitely would like to come back to try the rest of the menu.

This has to be the worst Nando’s in Birmingham absolutely disgusting!

I ordered half a chicken on the Nando’s app and although I phoned the restaurant and put it in the notes to give me two legs instead of a breast they gave me a breast .

It gets worst they gave me cold,old ,eaten food the wing on the breast look eaten and i think it was done intentionally because I requested two legs .

I ordered peri tamer and you can’t even taste it tasted like plainish .

I spent over £20 for eaten food plus there was no tissue ,sauce or cutlery in the bag .

If you come to Birmingham just go to new street Nando’s this Nando’s is rank and nasty do not eat or order from here!

If you ever order from this Nando’s and you want to add or change anything don’t even bother they will intentionally mess with your food Danny was excellent in his service as usual. My partner and I have been regular customers and the food has been always cooked with absolute perfection. Really enjoy coming to Nandos Broad Street! Great food, reliable and friendly staff. Ordered the boneless platter and this branch never disappoints. Exceptional service and special thanks to both Ibby and Faith today.

The staff are really nice and attentive but for some reason, I never get my meal.

Don’t know if it’s a curse or something lol but will definitely go back as it’s 5 mins away and I love the food. Bought the frozen yogurt but the machine didn’t work.. I guess McDonald’s jinxed them 🥲😂. Everything else was really nice. Place was clean. Both staff who helped us were very helpful, a brunet and the welcoming staff who was blonde. I wish I was good with names. I was wishing to try the Mac and cheese and the veggie patty but both out of stock 🤷🏻‍♀️ maybe next time We had late lunch here at Nandos Selly Oak today. We came there at around 330pm. They were quite busy as we had to wait awhile for the food. We waited a bit for the starters to come but the intervals between starters and mains is ok as the wait for the mains was not that long. Food is great though and worth the wait. Staff are friendly and helpful. Decors in the restaurant we’re nice. Provided that the restaurant is busy it was still clean and tidy. It took a whole for the ice maker to generate some ice though. I guess as the weather got a bit more warmer in the afternoon everyone wanted ice. Just the soft drink felt a bit flat so this might need looking at. Otherwise we had a good experience and enjoyed the food. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 I can count on one hand how many bad nandos I have had...unfortunately both of them were here, on the same night.
We waited 35 minutes for our mains, seeing tables seated before us getting served. When our food eventually turned up, all the chicken was cold, and the sides weren't any better.
When we raised this a supervisor/manager came over and took it away to get new dishes.
Unfortunately, when the replacements turned up, the chicken was barely warm again, but by this point, having already driven half the country, we weren't up for more waiting.
If it wasn't for the helpfulness and nature of the woman who dealt with us, I'd be giving this a 1 star. Seated quickly with no fuss. Food was served quickly and was fresh to order. The lovely lady serving us even bought over some Cucumber and Tomato's for my little girl to save us paying for a salad she wouldn't eat half of. The manager had to move us from the window due to a party coming in but upgraded us to the sofa booth (much preferred) and gave us free ice cream for the 'inconvenience'. Super attentive staff, nice and clean in there too. Amazing food and service. It was my girlfriend's first Nandos experience and she definitely wasn't disappointed.

I had the Christmas quesadilla which was really tasty with a mild dipping sauce.
The service was friendly and fast.
Only issue is the seating area is poorly maintained. The table I sat at had a broken chilli bottle that poured all over the table.
Given that it was now dry and sticky it was pretty obvious nobody has come past to clean it in at least a few hours.
Overall good food but perhaps they need to focus on keeping the area cleaner. Went there today and had a medium burrito eat in, and let's just say the portion was not even half of the one in Oxford. The bowle was practically empty!!!! Hailey was so helpful and kind serving us. We can from out of town and she was so patient with our questions. We loved her hospitality and genuine kindness. The food was amazing, but Hailey is the reason I gave 5 *****! Feeling absolutely robbed and scammed out of my money after this visit, will be the last time i do as standards are not what they used to be which is a shame. Prices have increased which is understandable but to reduce the food customers get by a significant amount is not justifiable. I used to always order a large chicken quesadilla which used to come with a bag of tortilla chips, salsa dip and sour cream on the side. However, the quesadilla now is not a quesadilla, it used to be made and cut into 4 slices but now they make it like a burrito and slice it in half. I was about to walk away whilst the staff were making it as i was appalled at the little filling they were putting into it. It now also just comes with the pot of salsa dip, no sour cream or tortilla chips, you have to pay extra for that. I used to be absolutely full from how the quesadilla that used to be made but this time i was left feeling hungry and disappointed, there were parts of the wrap that didn't have any filling in it whatsoever. Not worth the price paid and won't be returning. Tortilla in Grand Central was one of my go to places to eat almost everyday after work - I usually got the large quesadilla. I was SHOCKED when I went back in the new year. I asked for a large pork quesadilla and while ordering was not told that this whole medium/large deal had changed and it is only one size medium. While looking at the lady putting the topics I was SHOCKED again to see how little of the salsa and pork was added on, although there was a generous amount of cheese. On receiving my order I was confused - not because I haven’t had the new quesadilla where it is cut into 2 instead of 4 - but because of how tiny and light it was. I went to ask whether it was medium or large - and then was told that it is just one size now. Well, this should’ve been pointed out to me when I asked for ‘large’ so I could’ve ordered a side as well. I’m so disappointed - Tortilla used to be one of my favourites, guess I’ll just have to make the New Mexican places like zambrero and zocalo my new go to. It is actually disgraceful how the quesadilla used to be bursting with toppings - I’m not saying it needs to be that way, but barely putting on any pork and filling it with cheese is NOT the solution. The whole restaurant was empty and rightfully so - I don’t see why anyone would want to pay big bucks for such small portions.",0.4,0.4,"[""Mexican"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Mediterranean""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size""]"

I highly recommend him to anyone dealing with back issues or looking for a skilled and knowledgeable practitioner. Fantastic experience from start to finish! This doctor is amazing.

Very easy to get an appointment. Upon arrival, free parking if available on the drive.

Dr Robert is brilliant doctor (if you allowed to call him that). He asked a series of questions and does a small diagnosis physically on you. He is straight away able to identify the problem.

Although he booked me for 1 hour; we surpassed our time and he completed his session. He gave clear instructions on what he's doing to me and assured me every step.

I was very happy that he broke the technical terms and explained whilst working on my body.

Feel so much better after visiting him. His prices are very good and reasonable in comparison to other places. Will definitely come back if I require his services again. I had been suffering with back pain for weeks. Spent an hour with Rob. Felt the difference immediately. Amazing. Robert is both professional and friendly. He made my first visit very relaxing despite me being nervous, not knowing what to expect and I would highly recommend him to you as well.
I've been visiting Robert probably for the last 8 years now. I did my research on local chiropractors at the time and Robert's practice was the most suitable.
His very knowledgeable about his work and regularly shares best posture techniques to resolve any issues I have. He managed to pin point my back issues with extreme accuracy and cure my suffering.
I have recommend Robert many times to family members and friends, who have never been disappointed with my recommendation. I've been visiting Rob at Chiro relief for maybe 10 (?) years now for regular maintenance on a dodgy back, after recommendation from a friend.

Sessions would often start late (even though finishing on time), was given generic advice, and would often be left for 40 mins in the room with just a electrical stimulating device on my back the physio disappearing out of the room for most of the session.

We had the prawn & scallop starters & we both decided on the crab linguine. The portions are far more generous than other restaurants in the centre of Birmingham & it's great value for money. I had a brilliant evening at La Galleria. The service was warm and friendly from the moment I walked in, and the whole place had a really cosy, authentic Italian feel.

I started with the meatballs, and they were absolutely delicious – tender, full of flavour, and served in a rich, tasty sauce. For my main, I had a pizza, and it was spot on. Perfectly thin and crispy base, generous toppings, and that proper wood-fired taste you only get at a good Italian place.

The atmosphere was relaxed but lively, and I could tell a lot of people there were regulars – always a good sign. I left feeling full, happy, and already planning my next visit.

Other important notes, this place does not accept cash/coin payments, only via card. So if you’re a O.G who would like to pay by cash/coins, I would not recommend this cafe to you.

Being able to order to the table is brilliant as I could get settled and not worry about leaving my things to order. Toilets upstairs and downstairs, accessible and clean. Staff are friendly. A real gem of Birmingham. I come here every morning before work without fail. The team are incredible and always remember my order and know where I love to sit. They’re so accommodating!
Absolutely love it here, I’m able to bring meetings here and it’s super convenient. Massive thank you to Ram, Luke and the rest of the gang! Nice coffee shop in Colmor Row. Staff were friendly & helpful.  We ordered our 2 coffees  & then given an order number for the table. The interior is a combination of open brick work, soft lighting, and wooden accents, which sets itself apart from other coffee shops.  We waited for a couple of minutes & our coffees we're brought to the table. Nice informal atmosphere where you can meet up with friends or do some work quietly on a laptop. I’ve been a loyal customer at this cafe for a year and I always come with my family. I even have a membership and visit often because I really liked this place. But sadly, I had another disappointing experience.

This is the second time this has happened. I came with my whole family and my little brother, who is 5 years old, had his own food because he can’t eat anything else. He was the only one with food from outside the rest of the family were going to order from the cafe as usual.

Unfortunately, the staff didn’t allow us to stay because of my little brother’s food. They were not helpful at all and didn’t even try to understand the situation.

I felt really unwelcome and disappointed because I’ve supported this cafe for a whole year and always recommended it to others. But after this, I won’t come back again. I hope they change this policy for kids with special food needs, but for me, I won’t visit this place anymore.",0.8,0.2,"[""Burger"", ""Cafe"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience""]"

When you enter the staff are super friendly and explain everything to you. The complimentary food and drink selection is awesome and the unlimited hot drinks are not just your basic tea bags and coffee granules. The selection of things to paint is also great really high quality prices and very on trend.

100% worth a visit! Me and my friend went here, lovely place. They offer a snack and a cold drink with your time slot and unlimited hot drinks! The staff are nice and friendly and they teach you the best ways to paint on your chosen item. The wait to pick up the item isn’t too long either! Found the glaze room from a tiktok review. Booked the experience as a date and we had a fantastic time!
The atmosphere was really calm and chill even with every table occupied. The lighting was soft, bright and beautiful. Song after song that they played really hit the spot. The decor was welcoming and functional (although somewhere to hang coats/bags is a must!).
We were greeted by Esther who led us through the whole process. They were super helpful and friendly without being intrusive which I appreciate.
We picked out our items to paint. We were bracing ourselves for the high prices and still they were more than expected. There were a lot of choices for the items and glaze colours.

Esther gave a short demo and was available to answer further questions throughout the session which we made full use of. Our booking was for a 2hour slot starting at 6pm however we didn't end up leaving until just before 9 which meant we could take our time and our designs weren't rushed.

I would recommend having a think about your design/colour scheme before coming so you can jump right in. We searched for reference photos and used the pencils, brushes and detailing bottles to bring them to life.

It was so much fun!
Also included, were a drink and snack each. Highly recommend the kinder bueno cookie. A vegan cookie was also available as well as a bottomless tea/coffee station.

To reserve your booking, it is £10pp and then on top of that, you pay for your item/s on the day. They are labelled in the photo. We spent £35 each.

Don't let the prices put you off, especially if you enjoy art. We almost didn't go because of it but you aren't just paying for the studio time and blank pottery, you are paying for the whole experience and it is so worth it!!

We are so excited to see our fired pieces in 2 weeks time and probably coming back to do more! Brilliant couple of hours spent with friends decorating a variety of pottery items. The space is busy but well laid out, the staff are lovely and helpful with advice and information (but get out of the way quickly to allow you to create!). I booked in with 9 friends and we had a really mindful and enjoyable couple of hours on a Sunday. The included snacks and drinks are quality too! Will be back! Absolutely stunning place! I went here with a group of friends for my birthday. The vibes were very chill and the place is decorated beautifully. I loved that it included drinks and snacks. The staff was super helpful from booking my slot to collecting our pottery items. The finished piece looked shiny and bright. There is a wide selection of items to choose from. Great location as it is central. I would definitely recommend coming here.

Staff were friendly, kind and efficient. Must make particular mention of Smita- lovely smile even at the end of what must have been a very long and busy day for them. Thank you for the ice! Quick, friendly service.  Food and drink are good value.  Clean and bright, good location (in Library) It gets very busy in the evening.  Will go again. The worst university café this is.

The staff is dishonest and rude.

I should've read the reviews before coming but I didn't, as many others agree that the staff is rude.

I came to buy a £4 meal deal, which fits my budget as a student. The meal deal includes a sandwich, a drink, and a snack. However, the particular sandwich I picked up wasn't included in the meal deal, so I ended up paying £7.90, it's my fault really, but the staff was annoyed when I asked.

I was gonna buy a cup of tea but I've already used up my lunch budget, so I asked the staff politely if she could fill my cup with some hot water please, she told me that their hot water machine is broken too, same as the one in library lounge. Yes the one in library lounge is broken, that's why I asked if I could get some hot water from the café, after paying for a meal as a customer. But the machine in the café isn't broken. All other customers behind me all managed to get tea that's filled with hot water.

Is it that hard to be a nice, decent and considering human once for a while?

The library staff is 10/10. The library café staff is 0/10. They made good coffee here. Staff were friendly. Great atmosphere in a modern building within the University of Birmingham campus. I can honestly say I've just had the worst cheese sandwich ever.£7.00 for stale bread and cheese spread, not even real cheese. Told they don't sell tomatoes so can't have them.

The Bull Ring Market is my go-to spot for affordable and authentic African products. You’ll find everything from fresh food items to traditional fabrics, spices, and household essentials all at very reasonable prices. The market is lively, with friendly vendors and a welcoming atmosphere.

If you're looking to shop quality on a budget, this is definitely the place. Highly recommended! A Fantastic Day Out at the Bullring Fish & Meat Market

I always enjoy my trips to the Bullring Market – especially the fish and meat section, which is all under one clean, well-kept building. There’s a brilliant variety of fresh fish, meats, and even vegetables – something for every taste. My wife and I love going together to pick out the best cuts and freshest catch of the day. It’s more than just shopping – it’s a fun day out for the whole family. The friendly atmosphere, great prices, and top-quality produce make it one of Birmingham’s true hidden gems. Highly recommended – check out my photos to see why!
Follow more of my reviews and activities on Instagram: @h_bermani Bought some crabs at the newly opened seafood stall near to the centre of the entrance from China town.  It wasn't cheap.  When I was washing the crabs it got horrible smell.  I was sure they weren't fresh.  Still tried to cook it as normal and nicely. Unfortunately, it tasted amonia and the bad smell still there after cooking.  Had to bin it straight away.  This shop has no conscience to provide such poisonous seafood! Decent food for really low prices. Although you do have to make sure to check all the food you're buying, because sometimes it has fungus. The stalls only sell food that is in season. Way cheaper than a grocery store so I recommend buying food essentials there (e.g. vegetables, fruits, etc). You get foods that you wouldn't usually find in a grocery store, so if you want to try something new, this would be a good opportunity.
The market is really dirty, I don't think they clean it very often. I go there almost every week, and there is usually a drunkard or another kind of weirdo, but if you stay out of their way, then they ignore you. You can get high quality stuff second hand and new done stuff you find is marks and Spencers quality like underwear and such you can find herbs and spices .watch fixing at a good price scented candles and incense, clothing for work such as high vis.these are just some of the business I have frequented (replica perfumes)",0.6,0.4,"[""Seafood"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

Somehow the mushrooms were greasy. Hashbrown's were crispy but wet with grease. The beans were ok and sausages taste nice but greasy. I ordered brown toast received white. The coffee tasted salty somehow. Maybe dishwasher cleaner or something. Horrible.

So I basically ate 1 hashbrown, 2 sausage, 3 half toast, beans but not all and 1 egg for £13!

The music was the best experience Food standard has deteriorated massively . Eggs were hard and rigid , hash brown lacking the usual flavour and worse of all sausages were rock hard that even using a knife was a struggle. Not sure what happened to the standard of this place ?
Used to frequent it weekly . Came back after almost 2 months and was aghast at how poor the food now has become Breakfast was awful,sausage tasted like pure fat,bacon was hard and cold,mushrooms like they had been found the on the floor all with ten baked beans!
On bright side the coffe was nice.

The hostess/ waitress was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes. She made us feel extremely welcome.

Food was amazing and portion sizes were generous.

A real big hats off to the young gent serving us all night - lovely gent.

Thank you Locanta - see you again soon! This was a last minute decision to eat out on Christmas Day, given I'd been at work all day. A bit of a wait for starters and main. Starters were enjoyable, however after a chat with the owner/manger who was a pleasant and friendly gentleman I opted for an off menu steak option. In the mangers defense he did say it was a 'big' Ribeye cut and offered a decent discount, BUT I should have asked how big before saying medium rare. When it eventually arrived, it was more than a kilo, absolutely huge. This size of steak doesn't fair well rare and the fat was totally unedible, and parts of the meat almost raw were chewy and very difficult to cut with all the tendons. The accompanying diane sauce was nice, veg aldente, however the potatoes were a little dry and overcooked. My daughters seafood linguini was ok however, she found the sauce a little spicy and the scallops chewy. I took most of my Ribeye home and finished it off in the oven next day for dinner and it was lovely. The lesson for me on this dining experience is that bigger is most certainly not always better 😆 I would be open to revisting to try something else off the menu. Wow! Best restaurant experience for a long while. We went in and said we were celebrating our son’s exam success and we were treated like royalty.

Today, for the first time, Olivia reached the very top of the wall — she was over the moon! It was a proud and joyful moment, and I could truly see a love for climbing beginning to grow in her. I’m so grateful for Chantal and the Rock Up team. You’ve planted a climbing seed in my child’s heart, and we’ll be back every week to nurture it. Hope to see you again each time, Chantal — we love you guys! I went to rock up at Birmingham i really enjoyed it was a very good experience . I liked how when you went to climb on the obstacles it had a difficult levels to do which made it much more intense . I came in my size 8 sliders but the rules where I wasn't allowed to so I had to borrow my mums size 6 shoes haha .

I mean it could be slightly better if I am honest but if you have the right ticket you can avoid the temptations of spending more money in the station or getting on with work.

Location is a bit of a pain if you are due to travel from platforms 6 upward as you have to go out of the ticket barrier and in through another one.

Good size portion, good price and nice fresh ingredients make it difficult to fault the place. Don't know how fast service will be it was really busy but I shouldn't imagine too long with the menu.

I would definitely recommend. Food was delicious. Reasonable price. I got the large falafel wrap. Perfect for takeout or work lunch. The photo I took doesn’t do it justice. Amazing place. Fresh food. Falafels are INSANE. Smoothies and juices are also delicious. Kind, welcoming staff. What a lovely place. Mum is vegan and she adores it here! It is 100% vegan too!! It would be better if you will add fries so it's legit. but all in all it was fine and servings are big.
I got medium size falafel. It is made to order for me and it taste so delicious.

Otherwise, all good. Good location. Nice big size with plenty of tables. Coffee and tea were very good while the cakes I believe were overpriced. Toilets are unisex but were in a terrible state. Staff were attentive and engaging. Didn’t want cream, but wanted it full for £3.70.

Absolutely no care given by staff, this is the second time the same member of staff has done this. No excuse for not reading order, when receipt expressly states no cream, and especially no excuse giving me a drink that looks like someone’s already had a go at it!

What blew me away is  how i witnessed Chris deal with a disabled customer. Not fair to go into detail. However what i saw blew my mind. Chris helped this guy with compassion and dignity and a smile.

•	The staff are great – very friendly and welcoming.
•	The coffee tastes really good, especially the cappuccino. Smooth and rich!
•	There’s a lovely outdoor seating area too, great for sunny days.

It is a bit pricier than other popular coffee chains, but honestly, the vibe and quality make it worth it. Definitely coming back! Delightful light lunch and coffees here, in a warm and comfy setting. The Classic Bennie bap £8.95 and the soup of the day £6.95 were delicious. The sun was shining on our faces and it was bliss. Coffees were nice but a bit dear I thought £4.10 and it's 50p extra for decaf. This place is so lovely. It's really relaxed, welcoming and the food is great. I get anxious going out, because you don't know how each business works from place to place, but Urban cafe has clear signage and instruction; you can take a seat, and order at the till when you're ready. This was actually really helpful to me. The staff are so polite and helpful. The place is clean, the menu options are great. My poached eggs were perfect! Honestly, can't fault it. The food was good, the location was good, the place looked great and it was a good find. The charter said they value gig customer service, so the person who served us must have been having a bad day.  Later as they were tidying another table away, they really weren't happy about it. Think they need to find another job. Ordered the royal eggs benedict and it hardly had any hollendase sause at all. You can't taste it or see it. As you can see in the picture it wasn't to be seen. They did go and get me a hug but I had to wait 5 mins for it. We had already had to wait 40 mins for the food ( which we knew about ) but my food was going cold whilst I was waiting for the sauce that was supposed to be on it!! And the main feature.

There was a good 5/6 members of staff on but the tables were not getting cleared, we had to clear our own table. The staff were not friendly, they looked and acted like they didn't want to be there!

They also offers delicious pastries and light snacks that pair perfectly with their beverages. I approve 👍🏾 Came on a Sunday morning and found this to be a chilled place to hang out for a while.

Good coffee. Comfortable seating. Music is suitably quiet. A handful of solo people on laptops. No stress. Definitely better than the big chain coffee place opposite!

Never buy coffee from there again Quite small but open later than most Pret’s and coffee shops which is a bonus.

Visited quite late on a Saturday and they had very little food left which was disappointing but to be expected at 7pm.

They did have a tuna sandwich and I was grateful to have that and also always love the crispness of Pret crisps (one of my top fav crisp brands). Making coffee isn’t just about pressing a button and adding warm milk, it’s an art. That’s why you have to have trained baristas which this place is really lacking.

⭐⭐⭐⭐

We recently visited Varanasi Restaurant on Broad Street to celebrate my wife’s birthday, and it turned out to be a fantastic experience from start to finish.

The ambiance was elegant and inviting, with beautiful decor that instantly set the mood for a special evening. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive throughout our visit, making sure everything was perfect for the occasion.

We thoroughly enjoyed the food – every dish was bursting with flavour and presented beautifully. From the starters to the mains, everything tasted authentic and delicious. The cocktails were equally impressive!

The restaurant is a bit over priced with even the chutney and sauces being charged. Had my first visit to Birmingham and chose this restaurant, what a great decision! The ambience was absolutely spectacular, with stunning decor and a well-thought-out theme that made the experience even more enjoyable. The staff were friendly and attentive, and our food arrived promptly.

Speaking of the food, it was delicious. Generous portions, beautifully presented, and full of flavour. Definitely a great spot for a lovely dining experience. Also, there were plenty of picture perfect spots, which I really enjoyed.

Would highly recommend this restaurant for date nights and birthday celebrations. Honestly an amazing experience. From the entrance to the table. Love the water fall. Staff are very professional and quite quick with the service. The food is delicious. I’m not a fan of panna cotta but my boyfriend loves it from here. The lollipop chicken isn’t much of how a lollipop chicken should look, but it was tasty. The wet tissue and the hand cream are a great addition to the  service. The food is pricey,  but it’s worth it for the quality of the food and the decor and vibes. Would definitely recommend varansi Rafi looked after our group of 10 NHS work colleagues exceptionally well.  We had a lovely meal both meat & vegetarian.  Beautiful decor, Rafi showed us around the restaurant, we were very impressed.  We had a lovely experience and thoroughly recommend Varanasi.   Thank you Rafi for a wonderful evening. The most deceptive entrance to an incredibly impressive restaurant that made me feel like I was on holiday.

All the staff were extremely attentive and friendly.

The food was fantastic! Very tasty and cooked to perfection. I had the Samudri Khazana mixed sea food.

They did not run out of friendliness, enthusiasm and energy in all the time I was here over 2 hours during peak times on a Saturday.

Thank you. Very rude and unhelpful staff. There appeared to be an issue with the app. It appeared that they wanted to blame you and charge you extra. There was no apology for the inconvenience just extreme rudeness. You need to look at how your staff communicate and treat customers especially when it is in a hospital. I work as a manager in retail and the service was one of the worst I have ever encountered Standard Costa fayre but not standard costa service. Monosylabic orders given by server and no manners at all. This review is mainly applied to the service on Sunday 05-Oct. Just to be clear, it is to the kiosk by the information desk rather than the one in the canteen.

As a hospitality in the hospital, we don't expect much of “cusomer service“. However, based on the ""not-too-high"" expectations, the lady's attitude is intolerantly pathetic.

I don't know how much effort Costa would like to put on employee quality, but it is highly suggested to hire someone nicer for your business brand image, pleased. I’ve been going to this Costa for over a year. The service is impeccable, the staff (Chris and Destiny) always remember my order and make it slightly different to other stores! The entire team present themselves as energetic and welcoming whenever I go there, 9am or 6pm, same energy throughout the day even during busy periods!",0.6,0.4,"[""Cafe"", ""Mediterranean"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Value"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks""]"

It looks very futuristic inside and being a luxe offers that extra level of comfort whilst watching your film. The screen s are huge and the sound quality is great too. The staff are very friendly and polite and the toilets are very clean indeed. Certainly worth a visit if you are in the area and want to watch a movie. There is also 3 hours of free parking which is a big car park underneath the cinema itself. Just make sure you validate your car registration when you are in the cinema. Highly recommended The cinema is really great overall – the atmosphere is fantastic, and the movie selection is always on point. However, the prices for food and drinks are quite high, which can be a bit off-putting. Also, in some of the theaters, the seats aren’t the most comfortable, which can affect your experience. That said, it’s still an excellent place to catch a movie, especially if you get the membership for £20 a month. It makes the whole experience much more affordable and enjoyable! ODEON Luxe Birmingham Broadway Plaza is a top-tier cinema that takes your movie-going experience to the next level. The moment you step in, it feels like a treat—modern design, clean spaces, and an inviting atmosphere. The real magic happens inside the screens, though. Every seat is a luxurious recliner with plenty of legroom, so you can fully relax while watching. The sound and visuals are incredible—crisp and immersive, perfect for films like Moana 2. It's a great place for families, couples, or even solo movie nights. Plus, their snacks and drinks selection is solid, from classic popcorn to more premium options. If you want comfort and quality for your cinema trips, this is the spot. A massive disappointment. Don’t even bother going if your film is in screen 9. Massive tears in the seats, even in the more expensive back row. Projector had a problem where the image kept flickering brighter and darker. Two dots were burned into the projector as you can see in the image I’ve attached.

Nothing about this cinema is luxurious for actual cinephiles. No posters or marquees next to the doors, the lights were turned on whilst the end credits had barely started. All you can smell is the terribly expensive food that people insist on buying and (for screen 9) the centre of the screen is totally off because of the terrible placement of the fire exit door, which also remains lit up during the entire film I visited this cinema on 12/04/25 and had a brilliant experience. There was a small mix-up with the screening room at first, but when I explained the situation to the manager, they were incredibly kind and personally took me and my friend to the correct screen. The staff overall were extremely friendly and helpful, creating a welcoming and pleasant atmosphere. I highly recommend this cinema—it’s a lovely place to enjoy a film.",0.8,0.2,"[""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

Burger meat was tasteless and dry. The fries had the texture of fries that had been cooked hours before and kept hot for a while. They had gone dry and chewy. Ordered a cheese + bacon burger and fries, watched my burger sit on the pass for five minutes before being brought to me. Took a couple of bites, realised there was no bacon. Instead of replacing my burger, it was left on the pass for another five minutes whilst they cooked bacon and put in on the plate and brought over to me.

Fries were cold and hard. One of the worst meals I've had for a long time. Staff were pleasant but don't know how to deal with their own errors. Had a beef burger today and was rather disappointed - bun was tiny and the patty was barely thicker than a sheet of bacon. Taste wasn't overly great either; may as well just go to maccies. I was incredibly disappointed by the service I received at GBK (Selly Oak).  I ordered a vegan burger and a bacon cheese (beef) burger with Uber Eats from GBK.  When my food arrived (stone cold), neither of the burgers were labelled.  They looked identical, meaning that, without the labels, it was impossible to identify which burger was vegan and which contained meat.  Neither of the burgers contained bacon, meaning that we could not even use the bacon to identify which burger was the meat burger - and increased the possibility that our order was just wrong and that both burgers were beef burgers!

When we contacted GBK, they were really rude and offered no help whatsoever; we were not offered a replacement or a refund.  Uber Eats only gave us a 79p refund on a £22 order to cover the delivery charge rather than the mix up with the food.  This meant that we were unable to eat our meal and ended up £22 out of pocket and having to buy food from elsewhere.

Unbelievably disappointed.  If you have dietary requirements especially, I would strongly suggest not eating/ordering from here. Never again. Went today and waited 25mins, even though they were quite. Kids burger was black and burnt and I honestly think the staff knew it. A refund for the kids burger was provided, but I won't be returning and the staff don't really care and its very expensive for the quality.",0.0,1.0,"[""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Value"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

However, they did offer some very good and tasty looking snacks. We will definitely visit here again. 👍🏻 This is a fine place. A cosy and vibrant atmosphere inside, and then the seating outside, right on the canal, with people passing by. We came in winter and it was great. I can't wait to visit in the warmer months for more of the outdoor experience. What a cute little pub!
The cosiest spot in the winter time with only a few tables so it really feels like you’re in your own living room.

Food. Cafe food with mickey shaped items. Ordered 2 mickey waffles and was told the machine was broken and we have to have round ones. We continued to order and was still waiting after 30 mins.
Service. Not great. 1 bloke trying to do everything but not managing to achieve anything. He got distracted from every job. 3 women who had 1 task and didn't do any of it well or efficiently. Not even attempting basic customer service
Cleanliness. Poor. Filthy tables and floors and no one paying attention in the lunch time rush to clean up tables and keep customers coming in.

Might have the disney brand but it's a basic cafe in A primark. The Simpson one appeared to be better run. Utterly disappointed with our visit to the disney cafe , minimal disney theming , dirty tables menus just left on the floor.  Only went for a cup of tea which I thought would of at least come in a disney themed cup instead was given a white polyesteren cup  with lukewarm tea. The tray it came on  was disgusting and was told to leave at 4pm as they was closing . Definitely not worth the visit , it completely ruined the disney magic Not as expensive as you'd think and really delicious!!! We all enjoyed our lunch and milkshakes!! Highly recommended!! Visited yesterday and had to wait about 20 minutes to be shown a table, despite there been a few available the staff were thin in the ground so slow at clearing them. We only ordered sweet treats, waffles and cake which came fairly quickly and very delicious. Expensive for what it is and the novelty outweighs the food an atmosphere but the kids enjoyed it! A fun stop for any Disney fan!
We popped in for a Mickey waffle each as a snack.

They speak little English which is fine cuz you can just point at the menu but they treat non-Chinese customers differently. No basic customer service skills, no communication. The only times I've felt welcome here was when I would come with my Hong Kong friend. The girl who took my order looked almost bothered by my presence there but smiled at Chinese customers. Rude tone too.

Ordered kung pao chicken and the A1 option. When I got home I realized she didn't give me the chicken dish but another beef one. I don't know how she misunderstood since there's no beef dish next to it on the menu. They used to put a tea egg in the rice but not anymore which is disappointing. They sometimes give free soup with your order. Except that today I had to ask for it even tho the takeaway order before mine got free soup and so did everyone at the tables inside.

Located on busy New Street. The shop is huge and eye catchy aesthetic photo spots inside. The shop was busy and many people awaiting for seats. We went inside and ordered on the ipad with the help of the staff. We ordered the desserts and drinks. Arrived within 20 mins. It was tasy and well presented to us on the table. Highly recommended will visit again. Worth a visit! My wife brought me here for a quick cake-stop. I had no preconceptions and didn’t at the time know it was a ‘trending’ place. Overall, the cafe is very well presented throughout and I actually quite liked the pink theme. Very clean and professional. Cakes all looked amazing. The flavours were all fresh and well balanced - especially for my jasmine and lime iced tea. The cost is something I struggled to justify, if I’m honest - but I do feel overall it was worth it. Not somewhere I’d frequent, but is somewhere I’d visit again, if in the area. Popped in for breakfast and we were pleasantly surprised. We've tried to eat here on numerous occasions, but it was always full. On this occasion we were early, hence the breakfast. We both ordered pancakes, lovely. Service only got 4 stars as you order your food yourself off a tablet on the table and so, the servers only carry out the food. They were still very polite and professional. Will we return, definitely and maybe try lunch. Food is lovely and the service is now via a tablet on the table.  Always amazing cakes and drinks, I had a raspberry and pistachio macaron and a peach iced tea.  Lovely.  Is a bit pricey so only go on special occasions.  Staff are lovely and friendly and changed my daughters hot chocolate when she said it didn't taste if chocolate without any fuss Picked up a takeaway from EL&N in Birmingham and tried the pistachio round croissant and a Nutella milkshake. The flavours of both were amazing, especially the milkshake which was rich and indulgent. The croissant, while tasty, was unfortunately a little dry and slightly stale, which took away from the overall experience.

Service was great as always at EL&N.

The crust was perfectly crispy, and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. I also tried their kebab, and it was juicy, tender, and packed with spices that gave it a delightful kick.” “The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making the dining experience all the more enjoyable. Our waiter was quick to answer questions and offered great recommendations.” Ordered a bunch of items: Mix Doner Wrap, Hot Chicken Wings, Sausage, Spring Roll, Fish Cake and Potato Scallop. I would say the food quality was pretty average or even below average. The best food for me was the Potato Scallop, which surprisingly only cost 50p.

The menu is huge and the prices are very competitive. Maybe I should treat that as a warning sign for the quality? I also planned to have a try with their Cod and Pizza. But after the experience, I might change my schedule. Hopefully, I will not get sick after finishing all the items. Cash only, but the service was good.

There are definitely better alternatives nearby. Take your time and make your choice wisely. Popped in today for food, must say it was delicious, can definitely recommend the chicken kebab wrap. It was good value for money and the staff were fantastic, really friendly and helpful. Big thanks to the staff we will definitely be returning. The food is alright, but the service is bad.

We were greated by very friendly member of staff by the name of Megan.
She gave us time to study to the menu and she also offered advice on what was on some of the pizza's we were looking at.
Megan showed us the different size pizza boxes to give us an idea of how big the pizza's are. I decided that a small pizza was big enough for me however my partner decided he definitely needed a medium one 🐷
Megan was very helpful and found the best deals for us.
We were very happy we tge service we received 😀 Ordered a pizza and chips for takeaway and was really impressed. The service was quick, and everything was ready on time. Megan was super friendly and communicated everything clearly. Great experience overall – will definitely be coming back! It's certainly quite an achievement turning someone's pizza into a homogenised blob. However, the person at the branch was quite helpful and receptive when I called to give some feedback. Even offered to make things right. Hope they can improve. Ordered two times from this store via app, both took more than 1 and a half hours to arrive (estimated arrival times says taking 41 mins). Don’t know what’s causing them taking forever and ever to prepare the pizzas. If it’s lack of staff just hire more. Or if it’s because too much order during a period of time then just shut the online orders down.

It’s lights, airy and lofty with a slightly industrial feel. The staff are helpful and friendly and although I didn’t have time to eat a lot, I can swear by the great quality of the sourdough toast and peanut butter and sweet potato fries. I wanted a more traditional Lal vegan breakfast but wasn’t keen on the Korean beans and parsnip snidely do played it safe. The batch brew filter looked insipid but was so good I ordered a refill. Loved the process. It’s a great location overlooking the period building on Chamberlain Square but I’m not sure where the nearest parking facilities are. It's hard to review places on Google Maps without seeming like a bot but...I'm no Jay Rayner..so can only offer my own balanced views really.
Firstly on the day we went the service was good, the typically Hipster looking server who met us was friendly enough. The croissant I had was extremely tasty and the coffee was most..ermm..coffee like. No real issues. Nice looking place as well with a nod to our fair city's brutalism. Will go back Wanted to make my own impression after seeing mixed reviews. Unfortunately didn’t make the cut. The layout is a bit weird with cakes in the window far away from the till. If you miss the coffee menu at the front, there isn’t any anywhere else either. The floor staff didn’t even say hi, but the barista made it up for them. You can use your own mug which is quite nice! But the latte was average.
The view is good but the place is not outstanding at all, and if anything they got room for improvement. Came here Saturday midday with my mate. Staff members  Katie and T were amazing! They went above and beyond and told us from the onset that there is going to be a wait for the food which we didn’t mind. They offered us a complimentary brownie and T spent time to talk and showed her passion for the job. I must say I haven’t seen customer service like I observed today with Katie and T in a very long time and I’m glad they served us. Hope the manager relays this to the both! Keep up the good work! Interior is also amazing and much more spacious than the old place Really like how you can order yourself with the QR code. Food came out fairly quick and tasted just as good,

Whether youre a student studying or out with your family or on your own, I'd 100% recommend this place. Cafe Face is a small, cozy spot that serves a quality cup of coffee. My go-to is a Cortado—though it's not listed on the menu, the staff gladly made one for me.

I didn’t try the full menu since I wasn’t very hungry, but I did have a raspberry and chocolate muffin. Both the coffee and muffin were brought to my table, and I was pleasantly surprised to see the muffin served on a warm plate—a thoughtful touch that added to the experience.

The café is located near the university and is popular with students. Listening to their conversations brought back fond memories of my own student days.

It’s not a full five-star experience, mainly due to the slightly steep prices—but overall, a charming place worth visiting.

Cortado + Coffee = £7.95 Very tasty food, good quality. The bacon was perfectly cooked. More expensive than a greasy spoon but it's a different offering.

I ordered the fruit punch to drink, it was lovely I will be coming back. Great atmosphere, fast and friendly service, great food.

There was a long queue, and the staff seemed under a lot of pressure. It looked like they were short-staffed, and everyone was rushing around. A business can’t operate like that — there needs to be more staff to maintain quality and provide top service.
I’m a regular customer at this store, and I’ve noticed this happening more than once. I also have experience in the food industry, so I understand the importance of proper management. Some managers only care about getting bonuses👎 and don’t pay attention to the staff or service quality.
Honestly, I think the store needs a new manager, because if things continue like this, it’s only a matter of time before the store starts losing customers and its reputation Had a great experience at Five Guys.  Charlie was in fab and really helped me with my difficult order!  Had a great experience after a long trip running round the shops.  Really appreciate the wonderful service.  Thank you! Been to FIVE GUYS in a busy day at Birmingham.
The restaurant was beautiful and they have lot of Tables and chairs.
So, we sat there for a while and enjoyed our meal.

The staff are so kind and quick.
We had a Hamburger, Chips, Sandwiches and milk shakes with Sweet caramel and Oreo toppings.

Those are so delicious and Hot. Especially, we loved their FRIES..!!
That taste was ultimate and absolutely different from other branded fries.

There was a small queue while ordering as it was a busy day. But, the seatings are spacious and lovely.

If you’re looking for a delicious quick bite on your busy day at BRIM choose FIVE GUYS. Went there twice, very good experience each time and very nice personnel The staff were so nice!

ChIJF5clh4O8cEgR-EskG0QqegY,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Clayton Hotel, Albert St, Birmingham B5 5JE, UK",4.3,0.4971,5,4,1,0,N/A,"Visiting the hotel was a truly delightful experience, and I would like to share my thoughts. From the moment I arrived, the welcoming atmosphere was immediately apparent. The staff members were exceptionally kind and went above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay. The room was well-appointed, offering a perfect blend of style and functionality. The bed was incredibly comfortable, contributing to a restful night's sleep. The hotel's amenities, such as the fitness center and restaurant, added to the overall enjoyment. The quality of the food and the service in the restaurant were both impressive and memorable. Overall, my experience was outstanding, and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Honestly, one of the best hotels I could've stayed at for my first time in Birmingham. Everyone was so kind to me for my birthday weekend, and I got solid recommendations for exploring the town. The only downside I would say is that the air conditioning in my room wasn't working for the first two days, but it's okay because I had my portable fan with me. The construction in front of the building wasn't too bad; it wasn't noisy and it was easy to get around to the entrance. I would definitely stay again! Location is also such a plus with this hotel. We made a reservation to stay at this hotel on June 21–22, 2025. When we got to our room, we realized that the air conditioner was not working. First, they said they would fix it, then they said they would change our room, and during the last call, they told us they couldn't do anything and that we should make do with the small portable air conditioner in the room. In an environment where the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius, this is the level of service quality we received from the hotel. I absolutely do not recommend it. They were not helpful in any way, and the service quality is very poor It was one of the most uncomfortable stays ever in a hotel. We had booked two rooms, the air conditioning and air circulation system in BOTH rooms were NOT working. It got so hot  inside that the temperature in the rooms reached 29C, so you can imagine how badly we all slept that night.

I emailed the hotel and the corporate group about the issue but have not received a response from anyone.

I would recommend anyone heading to Birmingham to stay far, far away from this hotel and pay a little more or pay a little less and go with another option. It was not a cheap room by any means and they didn’t even have the courtesy to respond to my email. Great hotel located in the centre of Birmingham. I’ve stayed at the Clayton hotels across the UK. This has to be one of the best. It’s location is perfect if you are working or looking to spend some social time in Birmingham city Centre.

The rooms are relatively spacious with good bathroom and shower facilities. I was a little concerned that the work that is ongoing next to the hotel for HS2 would disrupt my stay, but actually the rooms are well soundproof.

Whilst the dinner options are basic and limited, they are good quality. The breakfast offered a good range of hot and cold, although my only criticism is that they were very slow to top of the hot options once they became empty. This was noticed on two consecutive days to the buffet. Hence my 4. Stars.

There was 10 of us and we also booked food. We sat upon the mezzanine area where you had a separate bar and toilet area from the main club. The food was nice, ate bread with salmon for a starter, lamb dinner with potatoes for the main followed by the cheese board. After eating the band starting playing and they were really good. We were able to leave our stuff at the tables whilst going down to the dance floor area, and return to the bar and toilet which was great as you avoided long queues. Overall it was a great night. Fantastic venue. We visited for the acoustic night and it was well worth the trip. Great music, lovely friendly staff, and a super atmosphere. A must see for anyone who finds themselves in the area Had fun last night. I went all by myself. Old folks who love live jazz and highlife music will enjoy the place better. The securities are good, bar tenders are nice. Overall 8/10 It appears the security here need to learn some simple manners. This security guard completely ruined my evening for my mother’s hen do and first experience of Jam House. There is a way to speak to people for a simple demand and also important to not intimidate people in doing so (still unsure why it took two of them to ask me to stand up). Likely won’t return.

It's not clear who you show your ticket to. The drinks were extremely overpriced. The seats in the cinema were disgusting, they're uncomfortable and hot due to the lack of air con. The screen was extremely bad quality, cut off weirdly, and extremely dark. Half of the speakers were off. The ceiling lights were constantly on. The adverts went on for way too long. Buying anything was difficult as the layout was very poor. And although it is not the cinemas fault, the people watching the film were constantly on their phones, talking, and getting up We went there for a foreign language movie and they killed the fun and experience by keeping the lights on. Lights on for a movie 😒 I felt that deeply insulting and the screen was smaller that with that distance it felt like smaller than my television 🥲 Easily one of the worst theatres I’ve been to..
Small Screen, terrible audio system,
very little gradient between the seats so it feels like you’re sitting almost straight behind the guy in front of you, whole theatre smelled like an old hotel…
“Premium seats” offer no benefit apart from being further back and have the most useless head rest (for my height).

Only positive was the friendly staff I had never really been in this cinema. Always walked passed it. I went to see Better Man which was epic; however I wasn't impressed with the screens, as they weren't sound proofed and these premier seats aren't as exciting as the name states - you just get a head rest. The decor wasn't good either, didn't look good and updated. Also, it would be great if there a little bit of tiered seating, luckily no one was infront of me, but I would have struggled to see if there was because of being on the same level. I went to see the David Attenborough film here and the whole experience was poor. Every brummy knows this cinema is awful, so my expectations were low. I know it smells and it's uncomfortable but... my word this screening was the worst yet. I didn't pay the normal £5 either, it was about £16 a ticket for this special event. There was nothing special about it. The screen room was one I hadn't come across before, and I was instantly transported to the past. The seats were somehow worse?!? It was damp and dusty. The screen was so small and old, the picture quality was awful, we get better quality at home. Let's say it was far from the David Attenborough experience you expect!  The film was epic, but I cant say the same for the cinema. It just left me wishing i had taken the tram to  Broadway plaza.

Single glazed sash windows, brown stain on the bathroom ceiling, antiquated lift, no food service.  The room was very clean however.  The staff were nice and it's right by the station.  Somehow I managed a decent night's sleep despite the air-conditioning units of the building next door going through the night.  Don't stay here unless you're prepared for the absolute basics.  I had to because it was works preferred choice because it's cheap. Awful and disrespectful owner/management
Checked in because of late trains the room was cramped carpet disgusting I wouldn't take my shoes off. Stench from drains made it an ordeal to use loo so much that I went to wetherspoons in the am for sponge bath and brush my teeth!!! Chair delapidated bad shape. I immediately complained and the night manager shrugged and said rooms cleaned everyday. Nothing I would have left but too late to book elsewhere so bared it requested refund was offered maximum of £15 disgusting. Room was ok, nice clean carpets and decent size to with a lot of channels, but dated rooms (Needs modernising) Needs more heating also (was freezing) maybe the heating that you can control like the air conditioning ones that blow hot or cold air would be better! Bathroom had no heating at all and the bed wasn’t very comfortable, didn’t sleep well. Other than that the staff were friendly and the location is brilliant! What a dump.  Great location and pleasant enough staff but that’s the only good things.  It’s old dirty and in serious need of either a good clean or new carpets and paint.  Some of the locals who hang out there are seriously dodgy too.  For the price paid there are much better places.  I wouldn’t stay there again Checked in around 6pm. Could hear chap next door very clearly talking on his speakerphone. From inside the expected solitude of my room. Could hear him cough, rummage around, flick the light switch etc. Wasn't happy but it was just for one night and hoped he'd be gone or be asleep later. 1am, wake to hear the pleasant sounds of him snoring through the walls. Decided to notify reception so they can't say I should have told them about it at the time. Their response? ""Thank you for letting us know"". Literally.  No apology. No offer to change rooms.

Well worth a visit. This proved an interesting restaurant.
It's very attractive to visit.Excellent location for the hippodrome theatre.
They certainly coped with a busy pre theatre lunch session.Limited menu.
Staff were helpful,at times we felt at little over stretched.
Food,in the main all good.Little touches would have raised the bar.
The sea bass was very good,but had been dried out around the edges,from the pass,which given it was busy was odd.
Lasagna,good,but lacking that crispy finish.Not exceptional.
Everything arrived hot.
Calamari,good, little rubbery.
Things like putting olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the tables would be a nice touch.
Mains came with a salad
The desert's we had were excellent  have to say,my lemon based one,one of the best I eaten.

The irish whiskey sauce I had with my steak (cooked perfectly medium rare) was absolutely banging (does come with mushroom, peas, tomato as standard but i didn't want them, fantastic staff! £3.75 a pint right in the heart of Birmingham City.

Definitely worth a visit, decent food, decent beer and friendly staff.

I challenge you to find a pint of beer of this quality at this price anywhere else in the city all day Monday to Friday

Update: I have revisited after a couple of months (which included wallet busting increases for hospitality employers such as minimum wage increasing and increases on NI plus costs of products reaching all time price highs) and what do I find when i arrive here? The price of a pint has come down by 35p on my aforementioned review.

Still giving the same amazing friendly service and now at £3.40 for a pint in the city centre while all others are starting to increase prices, makes this place a must visit.

Anyone catching a train from New Street and considering the pubs inside the station, this place is only a minute walk away and so much better.

Keep up the good work guys Went here before we headed to the theatre. We booked a table, when we walked in ans stated we'd got a table booked, they stated they hadn't printed the information off yet. When we were shown to the table the member of staff asked ""if you want me to clean the table, I will"" 😲 we only ordered simple meals fish and chips and a burger and chips but these took over forty minutes to cook! Oh ye, did I mention there was only one other table being occupied, so why the wait I'm not sure. We then placed an order for pudding, again simple, apple pie and custard and Brownie with ice cream, these took 28 minutes to be done, the member of staff did apologise but again for them to bang them in the microwave to heat surely shouldn't take this long...
The staff were pleasant, the food was nice but very shocking service.. We chose here due to how close it is to the Alexandra Theatre and we weren't disappointed.  Both food and drinks were priced well.  My husband and dads fish and chips were great as well as my crispy chicken burger stack.  There were plenty of tables to choose from when we arrived, but soon got busy, staff were welcoming, ladies loos were clean.  We decided to pop back into the Railway for a drink or 2 before heading back home.  Would definitely recommend and return. We’ve eaten here ALOT  as it is where we first met 27 years ago so the nostalgia is there for us.
Tonight we had some of the best food we’ve had here (we’ve had some good meals before) compliments to the chef, I am the fussiest person with my steak but it was spot on here.

It was a really nice experience, the food was nice but there were repeats on components across the experience.

The repetitive flavours were a let down but the overall quality, flavours and textures were nice and I would recommend people to try it. I also felt the dishes could use a tiny bit less salty. Let the other flavours shine!

We did also order 2 additional sea food dishes. The plating is super pretty.

I really enjoyed my mocktail and my king prawns.the dessert was super refreshing and light too. Delicious Indian food. We got the chicken for starter and the salmon, amazing. We shared the butter chicken, the beef vindaloo and the lamb rogan josh. Really nice naan bread. We also had the gobi and aloo as sides.

Would definitely come back again.

The cocktails were delicious. The last night in Bombay amazing and I had a cocktail that tasted like a Pina Colada. Our meal at Lasan was a Christmas gift (Gift card). The restaurant is very intimate and is beautifully presented.  The staff were very welcoming throughout the whole evening.  We arrived 30 minutes early and as it was quiet (Sunday evening) we were offered the option of being seated at our table or having pre-drinks in the bar, which we did - the best Passionfruit Martini I have ever had!  We were seated promptly at our table time and were brought a complimentary nibble with our popadoms, whilst we eagerly awaited our starter.  We chose a sharing platter starter of chicken, lamb, salmon and king prawn which was absolutely devine!  For our mains my husband chose a chicken dish in traditional curry style and I chose beef cheek on a dahl base.  This was accompanied by pilau rice, plain naan and peshwari naan.  Both dishes were excellent, although I was expecting the beef to have more Indian spicing - still delicious!  The naans were lovely and fluffy and very fresh.  Portions were very generous and we couldn't quite finish our dishes.  We both then enjoyed chocolate fondant desserts with pistachio ice-cream.  The evening was a real treat and we were looked after well by Vivek who regularly checked in with us to make sure everything was ok.  Would definitely return. Thank you to Arusha & Anshu for their wonderful service especially when they brought over a complementary surprise desert for my dad’s 85th birthday.

Food was great, beautifully presented and generous - although tailored to a more European palate in terms of level of spice.

Great experience nonetheless! Fantastic food, service (special shout out to Akhtar & Vivek) outstanding, just a really lovely restaurant that serves very tasty Indian dishes of much higher quality than your average Indian restaurant. We’ve come up from the South Coast but will definitely return. Totally recommend this restaurant if you’re in Birmingham or even if not, it’s worth the travel.

This spot is a little off the beaten track and not too far from the Mailbox, but well worth a visit. Everything I had was absolutely delicious – proper finger-licking good! The selection of beers, ales, and ciders on tap was impressive. The staff were incredibly helpful and took the time to explain all the food and drink options, so I could make an informed choice.

Highly recommend to vegans and gluten free, soy free people everywhere Popped in for a quick bite as we were staying at the Holiday Inn for a night and this restaurant was a brief 5 minutes walk away.
We booked for 5pm and there were 3 of us.  Two of us had pizzas and one had nachos.  We shared garlic bread a portion of tater tots.
Service was swift and server was friendly, we were seated at a long table with benches, only downside was the noise from the tables either side, totally just a me issue though.
Food was really good, fresh, hot and huge portions.
Cost was reasonable £14 for the pizzas and  £12 for nachos.
All in all I would recommend a visit. Had a salad. I know, really let the side down on this one. But my friend said her pizza was delicious! (Actually she said one of the best she's had in Birmingham, but I can't verify because... salad). But I'll tell you what, if you like garlic bread, THIS garlic bread is unreal. We need it mass producing please. The pizza is tasty, thin and crispy if that's your vibe, and there's a good range of toppings options. The service was a bit chaotic as it was very busy in there! Because you have to order via QR code the food arrives at different times, and because you've paid in advance there's no time to sit and relax after you've finished your meal. Sadly I didn't get the dip I ordered, and wasn't able to ask a waiter about this because they were so rushed off their feet! A shame because if this meal was a little slower and quieter, and if there was a bit more human interaction, I'm sure I would have loved it!",1.0,0.0,"[""Italian"", ""Mexican"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

Food was just.ok so disappointed.
Very little on my bagel.
The poached eggs on my eggs royale were overcooked which meant the food very dry.
I didn't return it as I was late and was rushing.
Otherwise, it tasted good. Lovely food.  Good prices, especially for a city establishment The food we had was actually rather good. The service is another story! We were shown where to go by an ICC member of staff (very helpful chap) but the B:eats staff showed us to our table and then proceeded to completely ignore us for 30 minutes or so. Had to go and find a member of staff to take our order. Eventually, order taken; by friendly, other member of staff. Celebratory fizz came with dirty glasses, which I had to return to the bar. They only had two champagne glasses, so we ended up with wine glasses. No matter; they were clean! The food was good, and not expensive, so, although service iffy, all sufficed in the end. Handy location. Delicious fish and chips, the fish was really fresh and the batter was crunchy, plus the chips were crispy, not too floury and tasty  Great onion rings!  Very tasty mushroom and dolcelatte risotto. Quickly served too. Just don't sit near the doors in cold weather! I hate to write bad reviews, but I was utterly disappointed by this place. I and two other customers were supposed to sit and eat at a ""table"" where in fact there was only a sitting booth without any table. Only after asking for a proper table the staff reluctantly moved a table to the two other customers' booth and others were sent upstairs.

Food was good, would rate it with 4 stars, however, the service was bellow average, you would expect more care and charm from the staff from a place with white tablecloths like that, especially when they add a 12.5% service charge on your bill.
As an example, the waitress dropped cutlery on the table whilst rushing to clear our plates and splashed my hair and dress with curry, but didn't seem very apologetic, only mumbled something about a wipe which I didn't understand - just wanted to leave at that point.
Overall, not sure if I'd come back. The place looks a bit dated and rundown (some seats were dirty, menu pages had folds and stains), not worth the money. For a dinner for 4 paid £150, so better off finding a local curry house.
✏️Update - had a call from management today about the review, seemed very apologetic, passionate about providing great customer experience and keen to make up for the other evening.

Door staff very professional in getting everyone in safely. No queues at the bar and decent drink prices for city centre club. I had a shocking and disappointing experience at this club. The security manager, who openly stated he was Turkish, told me, “I won’t let you in because I don’t like your nationality.” He identified my nationality from my ID card and used it as the sole reason to deny me entry. This is a blatant act of racism, which is both unacceptable and illegal in this country.
I want to make it clear that I will not let this matter go. I recorded the incident on video and will be pursuing legal action with my lawyer. Discrimination of this kind should never go unaddressed, and I strongly advise others to avoid supporting this place until they take responsibility and make changes. Best place to finish a night out!

Do not use this company for it's gift cards, they wash their hands of you when they have had they money. To top it all off it's taken them 4 months to come back with this answer.

Food is good but not exciting so normal chain manufactured edibles. i’m a regular at this starbucks so i know the staff pretty well. recently a new mixed race girl has been hired and my god is her attitude rude! i’ve been served by her several times now with zero improvement, it’s honestly disgraceful. there has always been a fault with my drink every time she’s made it too. all the other staff are so sweet and accommodating but somehow i always keep running into her. it’s just my luck I often visit here because it’s conveniently close to my workplace, and it has become my go-to spot for a daily coffee fix. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, making it a great place to relax during a busy day.
The staff is friendly and efficient, often remembering my regular order, which adds a nice personal touch. Ordered flat white and a tuna panini. I was on a business call and waited to collect my flat white coffee which was made fairly quickly. I waited a little longer for my panini but it wasn’t ready. I got busy with my business call and went to sit down with my coffee. Apparently the two ladies working there called me twice to tell me it is ready. The restaurant is fairly large and the music is loud! I was at the other end of the restaurant and didn’t hear them. I carried on with my business call and they just left the panini there to get cold and stale and stuck to the tissue paper. When I finally finished my call, 18 minutes later enquired about my panini the lady called Ladi I think; English white lady informed me that this is not a waiter service and the food has been waiting for me at the table. A mixed race girl then got involved and told me they can’t do anything about it as I should have collected the food! The restaurant was near empty! They could have had the courtesy to give me a nudge to pick up my food rather than just let it stand there for 18 minutes and get cold! Then Ledi the white lady told me to go to Costa if I wanted table service.
Poor customer service skills, rude and impolite people! Don’t bother going. There is a Costa on the other side of Morrison so listen to this Starbucks’ employee’s advice and everyone please go to Costa instead! I just wanted to give a big shoutout to Tory who served me today at the Starbucks in Five Ways.

Most recently, I tried the Bubble Fizz Strawberry drink, and it was really nice—refreshing and full of flavour.

Service here is generally fast and the staff are quite helpful, even when it's busy (which it often is depending on the time and day). The main downside is the lack of seating. If you're visiting with kids or hoping to sit and relax, you might be better off getting your drinks to go, especially during peak times.

Overall, a solid spot for bubble tea lovers! Have been a few times whilst i was in the bull ring. Lots of variety in flavours, so fully customisable bubble tea options. Really cute neon sign and menu is easy to read and choose from. Staff are friendly and get the drinks made in good time. Nice spaces for sitting too so you can dine in or take it away. Would recommend for place to go with friends I came in for a drink about an hour ago with my friend and saw the manager loudly yelling at a staff member. It felt quite unprofessional to handle such a matter in front of customers, as it not only created an uncomfortable atmosphere but also undermined the worker's dignity. Shame on the manager! Amazing experience with Imaan and Sameer! Great customer service and clean area! Bubble tea tastes amazing and is very customisable! This is my 3rd time coming and I’m sure to come again! Brilliant and knowledgeable service by:  shan + imaan. I was recommended banoffee pie supreme cold with cream and tapioca, it was 'banoffilant'. 10/10 I will be back again. 👍😀

Beer selection is great too. Lady behind the bar this time was very helpful and recommended a beer I'd not tried before.

Visited April 2024 and loved Tilt. Back this April and we came in twice on our trip to Birmingham. Great range of beers which my partner enjoyed. As someone who doesn’t drink I was very happy to find the vault city AF sour in the fridge. Good range of beers in the fridge to takeaway. Also had an oat latte and hot chocolate - both were so good! Definitely try a hot chocolate. Lots of different pinball machines. Friendly staff! Have seen this place in the local news and on social media a few times, it looked fun and I was in the vicinity so thought I'd pop in.

There's three floors of pinball machines and seating, and craft beers on tap. I started off with a few games on the foo fighters machine, which was great as it pumped out some of their best work while I played, and gave the extra incentive to play better and longer!

After that, I chilled out with a few beers, and got my wife a couple of coffees in. We went during a quiet time, and were served by the owner who I quietly recognised from media I'd previously seen. Service was friendly and courteous. A few times he offered to bring our drinks to our table.

My wife enjoyed the coffee, it looked and smelt great to me. I tried three different pints, but you can buy various smaller measures, which is handy as the beer is definitely not cheap, ranging from £5.60 to £24 for a pint! The three I had were lovely though.

It's the kind of place that's definitely worth checking out at least once as a great experience, but not somewhere I could see myself regularly visiting. I came in ready with pound coins for the machines, but I believe they sort you out with change at the counter if you're not as well prepared. Tilt in Birmingham is an absolute must-visit for craft beer enthusiasts and pinball lovers alike. The pub boasts an extraordinary selection of craft beers, with an ever-changing menu that keeps things fresh and exciting. From bold IPAs to smooth stouts and everything in between, there's a beer for every palate. The staff are not only friendly but also incredibly knowledgeable, always happy to recommend the perfect pint.

The real highlight, however, is the impressive collection of pinball tables. It's a rare and delightful experience to find so many well-maintained machines in one place. The nostalgic thrill of playing classic pinball, combined with a fantastic beer selection, makes for an unforgettable night out.

The atmosphere at Tilt is both vibrant and relaxed, attracting a diverse crowd of beer lovers and gamers. Whether you're there to sample new brews or show off your pinball skills, Tilt offers a unique and enjoyable experience. It's a standout spot in Birmingham, perfect for anyone looking to unwind and have a good time. Five stars for the amazing beers, fun pinball tables, and great vibes! Tilt is like someone opened a stylish coffee bar and then casually dropped a pinball arcade in the back. Great beer list — one of the best I saw in Birmingham — with a relaxed vibe and enough seating to park it for a while. The lighting is brighter than you’d expect for a bar-meets-arcade setup, which throws off the nostalgia a bit. If you’re used to the U.S. style of pinball bars — moody lighting, neon glow, machines lighting up the room — this isn’t that. It’s a little more “laptop café” in feel, but it ‘kinda’ works.

The pinball machines are separated from the main seating area, which is OK I guess. Also: no in-house change machine, and no tap-to-play as far as I could tell. There’s apparently a change machine nearby, but feels like an oversight in a space otherwise built around convenience. That said, the upstairs section (closed when I visited on a Friday evening) had a killer lineup of machines: Attack from Mars, Cactus Canyon, Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Flintstones, Johnny Mnemonic, and more. I’d love to see that area open sometime.

Overall, Tilt is a chill, grown-up beer stop that lets you sip great brews and maybe get a little nostalgic. Would definitely return — especially if I came prepared with coins and expectations set. Perfect spot for an usual IPA and a bit of nostalgia with all the pinball machines",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

They told me at the POS that they do not accept the Starbucks app, which meant I did not get 30% off and had to pay £6.95, which is about £2.00 more than at other stores. I agreed and paid for my order.

At that price, I was at least expecting my order to be correct. The order was passed on to a partner called Bertrik who made my order with ordinary milk, I did ask if it was made with Oat milknandnhe confirmed it was. I did ask for cream; however, he put the cream on the inside of the lid and not on the actual drink. I have never seen that before, so that shocked me. The drink was spilling over the edge of the cup when he finished, and he just passed it to me in a mess, which I had to wipe and clean.

I noticed straight away that before he put the lid on, the top of the drink was pure white. With oat milk, you get a yellow color on top, not white. Also, when I started to drink it, there was no oat milk taste at all, which again is not normal.

I took about three sips and stopped drinking it. I had to go to catch my coach but overall felt like I had been ripped off.

After about 15 minutes, my stomach started to ache as I am lactose intolerant, I can only have a little lactose before it starta hurting my stomach.

Also, on my visit, cross-contamination was witnessed. Bertrik made a frappuccino with a blender that previously had cookies and cream in it and did not wash it before use. My thought at that time was, ""If he is doing this, then he must be doing this with all the pitchers too."" This is a huge concern, imagining that my drink was made in a picter that had not been washed all morning was not a lovely picture in my head.

I hope you take this seriously. I have attached a photo of my Grande white mocha in this email.

Also No name on cup! No thank you on hand off.

Also did not ask for XH! I had a lovely coffee here today after my train arrived! Staff were so lovely especially thank you to Vini the smiley face on my coffee made my day!! Vini and his team seem unaware of the basic rule about earning Stars. They told me that it’s only possible if you have money loaded in the app, and not if you pay with Apple Pay or cash. This is quite surprising, as I’ve always used Apple Pay and cash and still received Stars without any issue. I believe Starbucks should look into this and ensure their staff are properly informed. Thank you Sri for Making my Tuesday morning more awake right after the bank holiday the coffee was so good and the shop is so hygienic and the customer service is topnotch Amazing coffee shop, staff really good and friendly, helped with questions about the Christmas drinks and despite it being very busy, it was a fast efficient service.

Asked for sauce. They forgot that too and when I went up to the bar to ask again, was told ‘not to stand too close to the bar entrance’.

Woeful. Staff training desperately needed.

Steak was ok though. Onion rings oily. While walking around Birmingham found this restaurant, looked very clean and inviting. We had the Sunday lunch, I had the beef and the wife had the chicken, and I must say the portions were a fantastic size and the pigs in blankets were out of this world.

Very good price and the service was the best I have had, Zoe was friendly and approachable. The atmosphere were relaxed and not rushed which is something i really enjoyed.

But the menu looks really good and we enjoyed the atmosphere here. So, we came back later for a meal 😋
I liked the fact it was next to the canal alongside the Black Sabbath Bridge.  A few steps at the one entrance but a level access around the other end of the building.  Also disabled toilets. We liked the fact that they do cater for children and they have there own little menu. The staff were friendly and chatted easily with us. Telling us about the entertainment they have on weekends.  I noticed quizzes too. So a good all round family fun pub. We really enjoyed our food. And can't wait to visit again. 👍🏻 The environment and atmosphere of the pub is really nice, it’s cozy and it has comfortable seating, you can also order from your table. There is air conditioning inside and there is a nice small seating are outside right next to the canal
HOWEVER, we got 2 of the Black Sabbath IPA English Ale ( based on the description given from the bar staff) however the beer was disgusting, flat and not cold and did not look anything like the beer that was advertised outside the pub ( picture from the beer and the advertisement are posted ). We asked the manager (Chris) if we can get a different beer as it was not what we thought we ordered. I was told that the sign outside doesn’t say that that the beer looks like that (very misleading). Chris told us that he can’t give us a different beer or a refund and that we should have asked to try it before buying it. His tone was very dismissive and he didn’t really care. Friendly service and decent beers on. Great location, nicely done up inside, and plenty of seating. Only popped in for a pint so can't comment on the food. Also, can't really fault the pub for this, but there were quite a few rude patrons lacking basic manners which kind of made it somewhere I wouldn't be returning to in a hurry. Food was disappointing, given the prices. They had run out of fish, surprising given that we visited on the Saturday of a bank holiday weekend.

The pastrami sandwich was £9 and looked thrown together with half the bread missing, and the bread was nothing more than a supermarket wholemeal loaf.

The chicken pie was totally uninspiring for a whopping £17.

We won't be going back and wish we'd gone somewhere else, particularly given the choice in this part of Brindley Place. The Brass house seemed the best place to bring kids in, meal time. Great range of beer. Fish and chips with a pint. Wide, colourful, ideal drinking place.

Really attentive staff who looked after us throughout and made sure we had a nice table and were happy with everything.
Fast turnaround on freshly cooked food and lots of options. Would recommend for families needing gluten and non-gluten containing options. The experience here was okay, but could have been better. While waiting for a table for two, we stood in the cold lobby area between the restaurant's outer doors and inner doors. However, we did not wait for long.

Our dishes arrived at separate times which was irritating. My teriyaki soba with chicken breast tasted bland. The chicken was very dry. I ended up pouring generous amounts of soy sauce and chili oil sauce over the whole dish. The coconut reika ice cream wasn't what I expected. It tasted like a protein shake powder. Great staff, fast service and amazing food what else can you ask for. I was invited by my friend who had food there before and recommended that we should meet up at Wagamama for our next meal.

The food was great!
There was someone at the door for meet and greet - very friendly girl who I just said that I am here to meet up with my friend .
She directed me to our table , my friend was already there.

There are vegan and normal menus on the table.

The dishes are explained well as the names of the dishes are a just little difficult to pronounce. They have dish number too so solved the problem for me!

Also, the table assistance was great.

The food came out quick ! It was well presented as given in pictures.

It was good temperature. The ambience was very nice.
The place was nice and clean.
Table were cleaned and wiped straight after.

Will definitely go there again 5/5 Really great friendly service, attentive and helpful.

With about 15 acres to explore you could easily spend 3-4hrs here!

Perfect for a nice relaxed afternoon if you go during the week, I imagine it's quite a bit busier on the weekends and school holidays.

Be aware that the hot-houses are very hot and humid! Probably 30-35? so if you go in the colder months make sure you can remove some layers easily.

The grounds are broadly wheelchair accessible, with sloping ramps. Although if possible take someone who is able to open doors as one door in the cacti room to an accessible ramp does get stuck and some slopes (while gentle for those walking) could be a little steep for a manual chair.

Plenty of benches around, some in the sun and some in the shade as well as a large gazebo-like structure near the rose garden you could duck into if it rains.

Perfect for kiddos, if you park yourself in the cafe with a view to the hothouse door you can safely send them off on their own to run around for hours. There is a plat area as well if that's more their thing than running through bushes.

Love the little shop, lots of gardening bits as well as cards, pottery and artwork all priced fairly high as you would expect for any garden centre/ public attraction.

The cafe seems well enough, again watch out for your wallet as the cakes on display look delicious! I just love this place. Love the gift shop, the cafe, the botanicals especially the tropical plants section and their carnivorous plants bit as well and the Japanese garden. The outdoor seating is a breath of fresh air and there is plenty of green grass for picnics. Weekend in Birmingham kicked off with a visit to this beautiful place.
Four people, two members and two concessions.
Great Japanese section.
Beautifully kept grounds.
Good indoor and outside spaces.
Child friendly.
Disabled friendly.
Loads of parking.
Walkable from town centre.

A huge variety of plants from all kinds of different biomes and environments, the garden was clearly well cared for and maintained, site was lovely and it made for a really nice weekend activity, we were here about 2-3 hours, wish we could've stayed longer but we didn't get there till late. Seems like a lovely place for a picnic, will be going back again in summer if I get the chance. A beautiful place to visit - particularly on a sunny day when all of the colours in the gardens seem to glow!
Booking was straightforward,  staff were friendly and helpful.  Parking is difficult as there are often too many cars for the car park.  Toilets were ok, snd the gift shop was delightful.

A Haven of Elegance and Excellent Coffee: My First Delight at Elio Cafe

My first venture into Elio Cafe, nestled in the heart of the Mailbox, proved to be a truly delightful experience. Stepping inside, I was immediately struck by the sophisticated atmosphere. The interior design is undeniably beautiful, with a clear emphasis on creating a refined space. The high ceilings are a masterstroke, instantly lending an air of grandeur and elegance that elevates the cafe beyond your typical coffee stop.
While the artwork adorning the walls and ceilings might be described as simple, its execution and placement are anything but. It's clear a thoughtful hand has curated the decor, achieving a sense of visual harmony that is both calming and aesthetically pleasing. The lighting further enhances this carefully crafted ambiance, creating a warm and inviting glow throughout the cafe.
The attention to detail extends to the furniture. The variety of seating options is a testament to the owner's understanding of different customer needs and preferences. Crucially, all the furniture I observed appeared to be of high quality, adding to the overall impression of a well-considered and upscale establishment. It's evident that the owner has invested significant effort in creating a unique and appealing environment, setting Elio Cafe apart from the competition.
Although I didn't sample the array of snacks and desserts on offer during this visit, a quick glance at the neighbouring tables was enough to impress. The cakes and pastries looked tempting and clearly well-received, suggesting a high standard of quality in their culinary offerings.
My focus on this occasion was the coffee, and I opted for an Americano with milk. I was not disappointed. The coffee was genuinely excellent, possessing a distinct and memorable flavour profile. It had a unique character that hinted at a blend  I hadn't encountered before, leaving a lasting positive impression.
Beyond the impressive aesthetics and quality coffee, the staff at Elio Cafe truly contribute to the positive experience. Their friendly and courteous demeanour made my visit even more enjoyable. Their attentiveness and welcoming attitude added a layer of warmth to the already pleasant atmosphere.
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Elio Cafe to anyone venturing into the Mailbox or even the wider Birmingham City Centre area. It's more than just a place to grab a coffee; it's an experience. The combination of elegant design, a thoughtfully curated ambiance, excellent coffee, and friendly service makes it well worth a visit. Elio Cafe has certainly earned a spot on my list of go-to cafes in Birmingham. Top mark's for being open, after most other good coffee shops had closed. A notable mention also, for taking Amex, when many places do not (not judging, I get it, but, nice for me that Elio do).
Burnt Basque Cheesecake, if you please. That's cool.
Atmosphere is light, bright, and airy (and a bit noisy, like most big spaces are). And the coffee? Expertly poured, for sure. Good stuff.

Edit: OMG, I've just devoured the cheesecake .... absolutely superb. Love this cafe, has a great vibe not to loud nor is it silent. The beverages are great my personal favourite is a strawberry matcha. Overall, price point is great. The workers are lively and respectful particularly, Zoe, who help with drink recommendation and excellent customer service! I recently visited Cafe Elio, and I must say it was an excellent experience. The cakes, especially the cheesecake, are absolutely delicious. The creamy texture and perfect sweetness make it a must-try. Their coffee is also top-notch, with a rich flavor that pairs perfectly with the desserts. The prices are very reasonable, which makes it even more appealing.

The ambience of the cafe is charming and cozy, with soft pink tones that create a warm and inviting atmosphere. It's a lovely space to relax and enjoy your treats. Overall, I highly recommend visiting Cafe Elio—it's definitely worth the trip!",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Sound/Noise""]"

It provided everything we needed for a short stay. Staff were friendly and attentive to our needs.

The oxtail was more bone than anything, and the steam veg portion was minimal. The rice lacked flavour, as did the meat, and I was just really disappointed. Then, I decided to order a piece of jerk chicken from the drum outside. That came to the table, and it wasn't steaming like the other food. Tasted it, and it was cold. When I then told the young woman the chicken was cold, she then went on to lie to me and tell me it had just come off the drum from outside. I'm certain that did not just come off the drum from outside as  it was cold and did not taste fresh. I wouldn't eat here again as there is nothing authentic about this shop or the food, and the young woman who lied to me did kill any hopes of a better rating. There was a young black guy in there who, if I weren't for him, then I would give this place the lowest rating possible. He made the experience enjoyable for me by asking me if the food was alrite and if I needed anything else and just generally a well-spoken, attentive, polite young man. Avoid this place if you can, as you will be greatly disappointed if you taste their so-called authentic food. Also, the price paid and the food of that low quality. Not again I went against my better judgement, didn't listen to the reviews and now I'm sat here hungry and vex. Caribbean Twist  you  CAN NOT COOK CARIƁBEAN  FOOD. Just call your shop Twist.  My lamb was dry and tough  the jerk ribs was burnt and tough. Caribbean food is more than just a bit of seasoning and chuck Ordered on uber eats at midnight. Never got my food despite waiting 2hours.
Called the store, they argued that the delivery driver could not get past the barrier whilst that not being my location and letting me wait. They also decided to gaslight me and then admitted to it.
After tried to reason with them they agreed to refund me.
I called the store again after 10mins, they decided to gaslight me again saying that I needed to cancel the order and it get refunded or pay £2 pounds extra to get the order. They also asked me to go to the shop tomorrow to see that the food was cooked, knowing that was not the problem. I see that as a safety issue.
Didn’t get to try the food but seeing how the shop talks to its customers, I am sure 2 stars is overrating this store. I’m so disappointed, I’m Jamaican and I’m actually shocked at how dry and plain the food is. The dumpling should be nice and crispy but it’s soft on the outside. I was looking forward to eating the Mac and cheese but the Mac and cheese coming like it was cooked a week ago, then got put into a freezer and then warmed up and served for me. The mac and cheese has no flavour at all. Worse max and cheese I’ve ever tasted. Ontop of that I order Victoria cake they gave me some type of cheese cake. The only two things that is decent is the rice and peas and the fries. I paid £24 for all of this to be disappointed. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS FOOD PLACE !!! To think me and my Caribbean partner are about to enjoy some good soul food to be completely dissatisfied!!!!! The food was BLAND !! The portion size is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE FOR THE PRICE !!! I believe the food is not fresh and has an off taste to it . For £17 we get 5 pieces of curry goat, an INCH of mac and cheese, rubbery and dry plantain and the rest just rice and peas and steamed veg. Don’t order from here .

This branch really needs to think how about how it manages its food safely & ensures it follows all safety & hygiene regulations particularly when managing meat.

Part 1:

📝: This restaurant/bar opened in Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham a couple years ago. Because my first visit was amazing and I couldn’t fault it, I decided to revisit. However, the  expectation second time round fell short.

The service on a whole was not good. After the waitress took the orders the menu’s were left on the table, empty glasses were also left on the table for the duration of the meal.

When I received my starter 2 hours later it was cold, I also had to wait around 45 minutes to receive drinks. However the cocktails were tasty and we were offered complimentary drinks for our wait.

🍴Starters
- £5.50 Spicy Chicken strips - coating had good flavour, I would order it again, but didn’t like the pepper sauce.

- £6.75 Fricassee chicken wings - balance of flavours was good , the depth of flavours was great you could taste everything you would want in a dish , the food definitely hit the mark.

- £6.75 Barbecue chicken wings - I liked the sweet taste of flavours, it melts in your mouth.

- £8 Jerk King prawns and Avocado salad - was tasty and flavoursome, cooked to perfection a really good dish

- £8 Coconut crisp prawns - They were nice and crispy but needed more coconut as I couldn’t really taste it, the peppered sauce was way too spicy didn’t really like it and it did not go well with the dish. I would of preferred a different sauce.

📝: part 2 - When I received my main course 3 hours later it was warm I was not impressed. I did feel like they struggled to cope with the pressure on Mother’s Day. I would not be in a rush to return as our experience this time round was not a good one. Considering it was Mother’s Day I was extremely disappointed.

🍴Mains
▪️£11.95 Veg curry - It was alright not bad, I would of pereferred potato and yam in the curry but it was just garden veg and peppers , seasoned rice needed a little bit more season as  it was very bland.

▪️£16.95 Peppered steak & white rice - Steak has a sweet taste not spicy , nice strong flavours, the rice was very fluffy And the veg was flavoursome

▪️ £22.95 Steak & rice n peas - my mom ordered the steak cooked medium rare , she was impressed with flavours of the dish especially the mushroom sauce which she thought was lovely and she enjoyed the cherry tomatoes was really tasty

▪️ £14.95 Fried chicken & rice n peas - Chicken & rice was dry needed gravy , food was also warm not hot enough . I would not order it again however the rice n peas was nice and fluffy, if it had gravy it would of gone down like a treat .

🍴Sides
▪️Dumplings  I wish they were cooked fresh as we did wait more than 2 hours for our food

▪️Mac n cheese - this was is nice not too creamy the consistency is  just right , the plantin was sweet but it was hard so not very enjoyable , I would of liked it more soft. Colsesaw I didn’t really like it didn’t give me the wow factor.

▪️£14.95 Bbq chicken & rice n peas - it was nice nothing special, i found it to be warm And I like my food hot with the steam coming off it.

It was the first time I went to the Restaurant, all the staff were friendly and very attentive. I went with my friends, they too enjoyed their food and service with a smile. The food was delivered in a timely manner, we received. I had side orders of sweet potatoes and colesaw, along with rice and peas, salad, salmon with a lovely sauce, the food was 😋, I also had a big glass of ginger beer, for my pudding I had apple crumble and ice cream, this too was delicious 😋. We were all full after eating our lunch. I would recommend trying the food at Devon House Jamaican Restaurant, I will certainly be going there again. Visited on a Sunday lunch time with my partner, the food was lovely however the waitress got my order wrong, I asked for jerk chicken but got the stew chicken. I was in a rush so really didn’t have time to send it back and wait for the correct dish, also not big on food waste. Honestly it was still amazing so no complaints there. Reasonably priced too although the table was very wobbly. Overall, it’s a cute little restaurant and good food. .
We was welcomed by a lovely young lady who gave us her divided attention which was very nice and appreciated.
The cocktails taste nice but less ice would have been appreciated
The starter of chicken wings was nice with a lovely sticky sauce.
We had the salmon for the mains with vegetables. The salmon was a very small portion and very little flavour and vegetables were bland and again no flavour.
I applaud the business but try to do a little more with the food as I would like you to prosper as I black restaurant and I will come again.
I hope to see you again soon.

Each time, I was fortunate to be treated by George, and I can’t speak highly enough about the exceptional care he provided. George is an outstanding physiotherapist, his expertise, professionalism, and dedication helped me recover quickly and effectively without having to take a break from my workouts and sports. His approach is both efficient and straightforward, making the recovery process seamless. If I ever need physiotherapy again, George will undoubtedly be my first choice. Highly recommend! I had an outstanding experience at Edgbaston Physiotherapy. The clinic was spotless, well-organised, and provided a professional yet welcoming atmosphere. I worked with Geoffrey Yu, who was highly knowledgeable and quickly identified the root cause of my issue. The expertise and patient centred approach has made a real difference in my recovery. I highly recommend them. Very professional, respectable and knowledgeable in all aspects. I've been going here for over 7 years to work on my rehab of my achilles, knee and calf injuries and isaac has looked after me, giving me the best advice on recovery and ways to strengthen to get me back to back playing in the sports I am involved with. Highly recommended if anyone would like to get back to living pain free. Service is the best I started seeing Isaak for persistent lower back pain caused by heavy lifting over five years ago. For the longest time, I thought I'd just have to live with it. But after working with Isaak to improve my mobility, strengthen supporting muscles, and stretch the area around the injury, I'm now mostly pain-free.

The process took just a few months, but the impact has been life-changing. I can finally sleep through the night without discomfort, and I can work without pain—even during long periods of sitting.

Isaak is a great physio, and I’d highly recommend him to anyone dealing with chronic pain. Huge thanks for all the help! I came for a rotator cuff injury and in less than 3 months it was gone. Not only did I receive great treatment and a list of effective gradual exercises but knowledge on the injury itself.

Staff were friendly, attentive and helpful and I can't fault them.

Order needs to be placed via a tablet on your table. I'm not a big fan of this concept but went with it. I found it quite difficult to order what I had seen on the menu as the two didn't appear to match completely, but that could have been down to my use of the app. Another issue I have with the Tablet order and pay system is I have to instantly decide on my level of tip ... Before I have even seen my food or had a complete service. This seems a bit silly to me.

Food came and the fries were fabulous. I can't help but be disappointed by the chicken burger and onion rings. Burger was very small for the price and was essentially a piece of fried chicken breast, with some over chewy and crispy areas. Onion rings were hard and too crispy and some of the onion was a bit rough.

I had a coke with my meal, the choice of alcoholic drinks was very limited, I think there was only Cruz Campo available (wouldn't swear to this).

Overall for a meal which cost me £31.19 including a service charge of 12.5%, other than the excellent fries I would probably prefer a chicken burger from McDonald's or Burger King. This could be just down to personal preference, but I am giving an honest appraisal of my meal and experience here.

Again staff were 5 ⭐, but meal and overall experience disappointing. Gourmet Burger Kitchen in Birmingham is in a great location, right by the canal, close to the Utilita Arena and even the Black Sabbath bench if that is something you want to visit.

Most of the food spots around this area seem to be chains, and I could not find any smaller independent places, which I usually prefer to support.

That said, this chain actually surprised me with the quality of the food. It was much better than I expected. The service, however, was nothing special. I was not a fan of the tablet-based ordering system, especially as we had major issues when it came to paying.

I would return to a GBK, but only if the food is consistent across other branches, as I was genuinely happy with the meal. The downside is the price. For a chain restaurant, it felt quite expensive, and to be honest, not entirely worth it. While some of the food is cooked fresh to order, it still feels quite standardised, and you do get the sense that not everything is made from scratch in the branch. The service also did not really add much to the experience.

At that price point, I would usually expect to be supporting a smaller independent burger place where more care goes into the food and where the chefs likely have a bit more skill and flexibility in how things are prepared. Fabulous staff.. the nicest people and they went above and beyond to make us comfy and look after my families needs. Food service fab and fast and tasty. We had naked bun and chicken selects .. which is perfect for a duo who like eating slightly healthier options. Only improvement would be drinks were all full of sugar … could do with some Holos Kombucha. I will come again :) great service, super staff, food is ok and the sauce a bit 50/50 too vinagery and needs to be re-evaluated so it has more quality.

overall a good place definitely worth going to for a snack before a concert Great location very close to the stadium amongst a number of food options.
Service was very friendly and they were keen to ensure all allergy requirements were cared for.  Mine were double checked both when I got the menu and when I placed the order.
Service staff are very welcoming.
The burger was pretty oily but tasty.
The shakes are super thick!! You are absolutely getting your money’s worth there, be sure to ask for a spoon!!!

⚠️ Exciting News! ⚠️
They are now open until 4 AM - giving you even more time to sing, dance, and party!
Plus, they are gearing up for a major renovation to bring an even better karaoke atmosphere for all our loyal customers. ❤️❤️❤️

If you're looking for the ultimate karaoke experience, Pad Thai is the place to be! 😉 Lovely Thai restaurant with Karaoke room. Food is delicious while eating you can enjoy singing as well. strongly recommended Thai style grill pork cheek, Thai papaya salad, wasabi king prawn, Thai pineapple fried rice, Thai mango with sticky rice. All the dish I ordered so nice. like them all. must try place. Good food and service. If you order the set menu you get the room for free for 3 hours. The Korean keyboard doesn’t work on the karaoke machines but Chinese and English work. £5 per person per hour if not getting set menu which is very reasonable. Really good value of karaoke + dinner combination, with a reasonable price and a good selection of food. The list of songs available in the karaoke system is quite updated as well. I have high expectations for Thai food and this place was recommended by Google when I came to Birmingham. The private booths are a cool touch as you can really chill out and eat in a group.

The food how ever isn't really a good rep for Thai food. Had the green curry and smokes ribs. The ribs were just deep fried with some sweet sauce ontop and the curry wasn't really ""flavoursome"".

👏👏👏👏👏 Awesome location for central Birmingham and meeting food was very good (I was there for work).

I know lifts break down, but we had specifically booked the hotel as we had a lot of filming equipment to load in, so not having the step free access did mean we lost a fair bit of time and had to lug everything up several sets of stairs to the ground floor (could be a really issue for people with reduced mobility/wheelchair users).

The room itself was super spacious, big high ceilings, enormous bathroom with amazing pressure, and super comfortable bed. It just took a while to find the room as they have names rather than numbers and I must have misheard the receptionist as was looking for something different! 😂 The decor/style felt a bit dark but that’s personal preference.

We moved a table in booked meeting room which revealed some dust/crumbs/pens so cleaning team may need to have a closer look, but otherwise everything else was tip top!

Meeting space was decent with high ceilings and big bright windows, right by a nice bright atrium for food, teas/coffees.

Tasty Food, But Can Be Inconsistent ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Pepe’s on Coronation Street is a great spot for delicious, flavorful grilled chicken. The sauces and seasoning are always on point, and the portions are generous. The menu has a good variety, and the sides complement the meals well.

However, the chicken can sometimes be a little dry, which takes away from the otherwise great taste. When it’s cooked just right, it’s amazing, but the consistency could be improved.

Overall, still a solid choice for a tasty meal, and I’d definitely go back! Nice and clean place. Had ordered chick and rice meal with piri piri fries. Was yummy and great quality and quantity. Will recommend to others. Friendly staffs. Fast orders. Had a great day. If I could give 0 stars I would. Me and my partner had ordered 2 chicken tasca meals on Deliveroo. This is something we occasionally order and enjoy, and we called up the store to specially ask for no siraccha on them as I’m allergic and my partner doesn’t like spice. The woman on the phone didn’t seem to listen properly but I trusted it as I have never had an issue before this. The order arrives and I can already see the siraccha dripping out of both of my tascas. I called up the store to ask them to re send them out, and the same lady answered and told me ‘we will just do better next time’, yet I’ve just wasted £40 on my dinner that I now cannot eat. I got passed on to a manager who told me to get a refund through Deliveroo, and I expressed how this is a joke as I wanted my dinner and would then have to wait 3-5 days for the money to come back into my bank. Very disgusted with the customer service and the lack of care when we are going out of our way to specially ask for changes on the order, I really suggest this branch trains their staff better with how to deal with customers, as I used to work at the Sutton Coldfield branch and we would have all our front of house staff well trained with better manners. Really has put me off ordering with you guys again, nothing was done to help rectify the issue from there end and left 2 very loyal customers very unhappy. The food is actually nicer than Nandos!

Thanks, Nisa, for your help First time experience shopping at this store.  I found it very clean and well organized.  Has lots of variety of stuff.  Mr Hamza good looking boy was very helpful at the tills and welcoming with his warm smile.  Efficient staff.  Highly recommend and will shop again😊 A lovely place to go. Store was clean and tidy and the staff looked very focused on their tasks, even though it was too busy they still managed to attend me and help me find the product I needed. I remember being helped by Alesia in that morning, she was very calm and quickly took me to my product.

We had a lovely time there, even though the tables were close to each other, the atmosphere was good inside, the service by the staff was exceptional, the food was good, especially the chaats we had as a starter. You will find street parking nearby and need to pay for it until 1800hrs Food was quite nice and okay for the price, we were given a complimentary cheesecake for a birthday in the group, which was nice. They were also quite accommodating for dietary preferences. Although one of the waiters made uncomfortable jokes with a hint of sexism when approached with a query. We visited Ithihaas with normal expectations but were absolutely blown away by the quality, taste, and service. Thali dishes can sometimes be hit or miss, but here, every single item was exceptional! We also tried the Himalayan Fire Ribs, and they were simply Top Notch!

A special shoutout to Jasi, Lavesh, and Asma for their outstanding service – they made our dining experience even better. The trip from Gloucester to Birmingham was absolutely worth it, and we’ll definitely be coming back again!

Highly recommended for anyone looking for authentic flavors and great hospitality. My 5 star should say it all🥹I tried few dishes 10 years ago in Selfridges pop up and now trying in their restaurant . Nothing has changed . The ambience and aesthetic was to die for. As u walk in I felt like I am walking into Maharaj Mahals.
Loved the Ramadan special Thali, food was well seasoned and cooked.
The drink JUNGLE MUNGLE was SO refreshing, absolutely loved IT. Visited 04/12/24.
The food was impressive and surprisingly above my expectations. This was recommended to me from Anita from Gucci in Selfridges. I wasn't expecting it to be any good given the names of the food on the menu & the price tag but it was impressive and I would go again. The only thing to watch for is it has double the price tag of food you could get elsewhere, the curry's are £20-25 and the biryani was £27. The rice was a large portion but the curry was standard. I definitely recommend it if you are able to afford this, as I found it delicious.
Service - was good, room for improvement here. But no issues.
Toilets - Smelt a little.
Food - Exceptional taste.
Price - Overley expensive. But worth it if you need a taste bud tingle.
Deco - some good things to take pics off, place had a more darkened presentation. We came in from the rain and the floor was slightly slippy, so be careful!

They also have a book of the month stand selling books, gives it a cozy cafe atmosphere. Staff are really friendly and nice so that's a plus, makes it appealing to visit there multiple times.

You can grab a book like i did and spend a few hours relaxing with a delicious hot chocolate enjoying your moment. Nice and cosy cafe in a beautiful square. Good staff are good and quick service.

My experience was horrible I felt so out of place and actually thought I was at the wrong venue . So after waiting in a queue in a busy coffe shop for over 10 minutes I finally got to the counter where I had to announce in front of everyone waiting in the queue behind me my reason for being there . Which was not ideal and I did question if I was actually at the right place . The ladies behind the counter were lovely and friendly but as I wasn’t asking for a coffee it took her two times of me explaining before she understood why I was there . I was then taken to a corridor where there was again a lovely lady who helped me but said it’s more a drop in hub for students and to maybe try a different one . I felt so uncomfortable there as I wasn’t asking for the only person there over 30 and even if I’d wanted to purchase a coffe it was out of my price range I think the cheapest one was £5.00 so who ever said students are broke haven’t been around students these days .

I recently visited this Costa Coffee in Birmingham city centre while staying nearby for a meeting. It was a fantastic experience — the coffee was excellent and a perfect way to freshen up my morning. The atmosphere in the shop is warm and inviting, and I truly enjoyed my time there.

The location is right in the heart of town, surrounded by a lovely area that adds to the overall charm. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better.

If you’re in Birmingham, I highly recommend stopping by this Costa Coffee. It’s a great spot to relax, recharge, and enjoy a great cup of coffee.

Thank you to the team for such great service! Absolutely must try the seasonal maple & hazel range. I had the hot chocolate one and it was DELICIOUS!!! The staff were a bit busy talking amongst themselves and felt slightly put off but still polite and courteous. The area was amazing too and appreciated inside and outside options. Overall wonderful time had waiting for others in the SeaLife centre. Great location, good coffee, friendly and helpful staff Good location, quick service, not bad coffee and good staff. Enjoy the atmosphere more than coffee. For a small Costa the staff here were very good... Not long to wait and found a vacant table inside... 🙂

We had hot chocolates and they were fantastic.

Some other customers with a young child got up and left a right mess on their table and floor and just walked out !!  (which I find appalling, they must live in a dustbin to think that's acceptable in any Society) I tried to hint about the mess they were leaving as they were dusting broken crisps off their child into the floor and table but it just bounced off them... If it was my shop I'd have given them a broom before they left !!

The young lady who was on duty just took it in her stride to clean up after these vagrants.

After a short time I noticed this same young lady go outside where a small female child had accidentally dropped her drink and was looking quite upset...

She helped clean up the mess and then made the girl another drink...

Definitely above and beyond from this Costa team member and the drink was great too. 🙂",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

I absolutely love the theatrics of their cocktails – they really create a unique, hands-on drinking experience that makes it more than just a drink, it’s a whole vibe.

The food was stunning! We ordered a variety of dishes, all beautifully presented and super tasty.

A couple of things that let the night down slightly: we were seated in a more secluded area, which felt a bit disconnected from the lively atmosphere. Also, the downstairs bar – which looks amazing – wasn’t open, which was a big letdown. Service was a bit slow too; we had to flag down staff a few times.

That said, we still had a great night overall. It’s always a cool spot for a fun evening out. If you're a cocktail enthusiast, this spot is a must-visit. The cocktails are not only delicious but also presented with remarkable creativity, guaranteed to surprise and delight. The nibbles complement the drinks perfectly, making for a great culinary experience. It's an ideal venue to unwind and enjoy a great time with friends. Went to the Alchemist today with my sister and wanted to leave a review, particularly for our server Eva! She was just amazing!!!

She was super friendly and helpful (particularly as we had so many questions on recommendations etc). She was amazing!!

Food wise it was good. We tried the AFC flatbread which was really good and the fried fish dish. Though the rice was a tad watery, Eva and the manager handled that very well for my sister! Would always recommend coming here! Went there for birthday drinks with a friend. We had some amazing drinks, really separates them from other bars. Glad to have gone there.

You’d think expectations would be low – after all, it’s just chicken, right? But there are still plenty of ways it can go wrong.

Let’s start with the chicken: overall, it tasted great. I went for the super hot and it was a good balance of spice and flavour – definitely the highlight of the meal. However, the spicy rice was a big letdown. It wasn’t spicy at all, extremely sticky, and honestly gave off the impression it had been cooked days ago and reheated. It felt more like sushi rice than anything that should come with grilled chicken.

The best way to describe the whole experience is this: like your local takeaway trying to be Nando’s. Tables weren’t clean – the place was quiet with barely anyone around, and yet when I sat down, my arm landed on a sticky, dirty surface. Not the best first impression.

The one real positive was the service – friendly and helpful. And because the chicken wasn’t bad, it’s not a 1-star review. But overall, there’s a lot of room for improvement. Stopped by after seeing a local band after a recommendation from a local. Was not disappointed. Fast, friendly service from Doc and some super tasty food! Can definitely recommend the Hot quesadilla!! Would visit again! I tried the chicken rice at Pepe’s, and it was a total disappointment. It tasted like it had been sitting around for days—bland, dry, and completely unappetizing. On top of that, the service was a nightmare. The staff was unbelievably rude, making the whole experience even worse. Definitely not going back What a shameful service waited for my chicken 35 minutes ordered Mega meal! They missed my Fries!! This is not the first time this has happened last time when I ordered rice were missing!!!! Staff rather muck about this the coordination than check the order making sure they serving correct order!!

The food was absolutely fantastic, authentic, flavorful, and clearly made with care. We loved it so much, we came back two nights in a row! 🍛✨

The service was warm and welcoming, even when we arrived later in the evening, we were greeted with a smile and never rushed. The ambiance is elegant and stylish, perfect for a relaxed and special dinner.

Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy high-quality Indian cuisine in a beautiful setting! 🙌 Blown away. Always passed by this restaurant thinking it's a toned down Indian restaurant serving tiny portions of Indian food, but oh boy, was I blown away.

I've attached my bill, I'd warn you though to get the prawns and lamb chops from the mains section instead of starters/appetisers if you're a party of 3 or more, perhaps a platter. Paneer flavour was amazing, my partner and I specially loved the prawns tandoori and lamb chops. Tender and juicy, well cooked, great use of ghee, just blown away. Shami kebab was alright.

Mains were insanely good, no jokes. The madras sea bream and king prawns biryani blew us away completely. Simple flavours yet seemingly so complex. Nothing overwhelming but really was a taste to behold. Get them without thinking again.

Absolutely lovely hospitality, didn't get the names but we were very well looked after. Great staff. Will definitely come again.

Alas, all good reviews have to come to a bad end. Pina colada was a bit of a let down but not really disappointing. Its just the way I am. I'm extremely critical of my PC's. Sorry to mention but you can probably pop into L*s-Igu*nas next door for it with a 1+1 offer. Visited here by chance, before seeing a show at the hippodrome and it did not disappoint! The food was absolutely fantastic and the service was excellent. The waiter was able to recommend dishes, and let us add to our order later on without a fuss. The food was value for money and the whole place was neat and clean. I have travelled and eaten at many Indian restaurants in my 51 years on this planet, and this place blows the competition out of the water. Service etc was excellent, but the food, it is simply on another level. Honestly don’t think I’ll beat this. Out of 10, I’m giving it 100. I will ALWAYS come back here to eat. This is the first Indian restaurant I have dined at, that the meals were perfectly made. Every dish I tried was delicious and the spices were well balanced and not over powering. The portions were great and very affordable.

The cup I was given looked like it had been used before — the lid was loose and didn’t feel sealed properly. The coffee was cold and filled way too much, making it really hard to handle. As soon as I picked it up, it spilled all over my car and clothes. Completely ruined my morning. Not what I expect from a brand like Costa. Had an Asian lady with black hair (Sordy I don’t know their names) make my drink and she was clearly struggling as a man came in and had to tell her to do things now and get another member of staff in. A blonde lady came in and took over and made my boyfriends drink which he tried and it was nice but now he’s too scared to keep drinking incase of health implications. my coffee has a black hair stuck to the lid on the inside and I myself have blonde/ginger hair. Please see photo. Genuinely so upset with the level of care or should I say lack there of from this one staff member as it’s clear the others know what they’re doing. My drunk cost me near £4 and it’s absolutely wasted ? £9 on drinks we can’t even have ??? Furious. Wont be returning to my own local costa. Really disheartening to see the care and quality of our food services have rapidly dropped. The two black guys that were on drinks and till this Saturday morning between 11:00-12pm thank you so much. They're very alive, friendly, inviting, they listen and offer extra. Being black myself it’s not something we experience often, so thank you for bringing the energy to not just me but the entire queue. I’m sat writing this as I sit in drinking the best mocha order I’ve had from any Costa and my order stays the same may I add. Customer experience and skill really does make all the difference. Thank you and best wishes in your roles, I’m sure both will do very well in life! This drive thru Costa is a great little gem of a coffee shop, it’s conveniently located at the five ways roundabout In Birmingham.

The drive through approximately 7 - 12 minutes as it is relatively small only serving 8 cars at at time. There are parking spaces with 3 hour limit I do not believe you have to pay for parking (I do advise that you check upon entry).

Inside of the café was relativity welcoming.
The staff where bustling about completing orders but no attention was given to the vacant tables that still had the residue of the last customers present and chairs that where covered in crumbs and juices.

It’s a little pricey for a herbal tea as one Jasmin’s and Green Tea Pot was £2.10 when it’s just a tea bag and hot water which is free of requested.

As you walk in you see several tables to be seated and the cold fridge for toasties and sandwiches some fresh fruit too. You can buy Costa merch as well like flasks and cups.

To the back of the cafè there is two cute meeting room type seating areas where you can really enjoy the peace and quite and maybe do some group meetings in peace with a nice coffee.

It’s convenient as it’s is on the door step of a well known hotel and the edge of five ways. Service is very friendly and approachable here. The atmosphere is calmer than most cafes and most importantly the coffee hits the spot! My go to: an iced oat latte with sugar free syrup! If you're about in the City Centre then be sure to drive thru and grab a Costa coffee!",0.6,0.4,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

Did not try any of the food, but looked extremely tempting. Beautiful interior as well. Fantastic - lovely menu, service with a smile. Both had burgers - great value, taste great too! This place is a GEM. The foul was lovely and the falafel were nice, if a bit on the small side.
The only thing that let them down was that they served me the foul in paper takeaway tray that not only leaked straight away but also disintegrated within 5 mins so when I took it out to eat it on the coach it leaked all over me and my stuff 😢 Went to see Alec Benjamin in Birmingham and had time to waste. A friend and I spotted this cute coffee place and went in and immediately felt welcome. We got a hello and we sat down in super comfortable seats. The atmosphere was really lovely and the owner (I think he’s the owner) was so sweet to us. I got a biscoff cheesecake and a hot chocolate for only 8 pound!! Really good prices and tasted absolutely amazing. I then sat there for a few hours to which was not an issue and then I ordered just a 6 oz burger but instead was given fries to go along with it. It was such a nice time and I am definitely going back For those looking for Middle Eastern cuisine, this coffee shop has various options for brunch, English breakfast and fresh juices.

Misleading consumer
We were not aware of the charges as our booking was at 10am. When we entered the shop there was no employee to introduce the charging requirements and finally we chose to pay 30 pounds an hour. In the middle of the process, we confirmed with the staff how much is the total amount, the staff told us 205 pounds, and finally paid 235 pounds at the checkout. Resulting in us not being able to make a reasonable choice that
At that time there were two options :.
1. pay two low fees: 108 ➕168 pounds, a total of 276 pounds low fees
2. Pay an extra 30 pounds an hour.

2. The service attitude is very poor.
We asked the staff for chopsticks and they just opened the door (without even walking in) and threw the chopsticks on the table. We went there for a birthday party. There’re not many food options and the price is a ripoff!! A medium size coke is £12 pounds?! But that’s like relatively the cheapest option.
The service was good but one thing was kinda misleading was that they told us we can have the room for 3 hours and we end up paying extra £30 because nobody noticed us times up and asked us if we wanted to have more hours, we missed the timeline. We went there at around 6:45 and ended up at around 10:30, we would have said yes if they asked and it’s fine, but they just keep charging without noticing us. That part just makes me feel uncomfortable We called to check if they were open for karaoke and they said ""yes, til 4am""
We got taxis across town and were turned away at the door for no reason other than ""Chinese only"". Clearly racist, AVOID if you aren't Chinese!!! Chinese karaoke. Private rooms are booked with large parties.  Food an alcohol is serve. Nice friendly staff and it closes early hours in the morning. Nice place to go with friends for some Chinese karaoke, food n drink is also served within one of many fantastic rooms to chill out in.

Always a friendly service, seems to multitask like a pro. Give the man a raise.

The cafe is nice too. Plenty of seating out back. I find their insistence over closing their outdoor seating area 30 mins before closing very annoying. They only have a handful of tables and chairs to put away - a five minute job- but ive even witnessed staff moving on customers that are already sat down and haven’t finished their drinks. Very unnecessary and unwelcoming service especially if you want to enjoy good weather, smoke or vape. Other cafe Neros are much more polite  about this and still managed to get tidied up before closing time . Visited today whilst Christmas market was

I had a mutton shashlick hanging kebab starter which was lovely. We had a butter chicken chooza which had a decent kick to it. We also had a keema muttar which was excellent. 5 of us ate here and we all thought the curries were full of flavour made with lots of fresh ingredients.
All the staff were very friendly. Bring your own alcohol. My daughters enjoyed their mocktails too.
Don't hesitate to eat here! I celebrated my 20th birthday at Royal Watan, and it was nothing short of incredible..

We started with an amazing mixed grill, packed with tender, flavorful meats, perfectly spiced and cooked to perfection, the fish being my personal favourite part. It was the ideal way to kick off the meal. For my main, I had a Kashmiri pizza with chips, which was a unique and delicious choice.

Having being on crutches, the staff were amazing. Providing seats with plenty of space and alot of space to manouvre with easy access to the toilet

The service was excellent, and the food was unforgettable. Royal Watan truly made my birthday special, and I’ll definitely be back! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality food and a great dining experience. Came with a friend for a work event and travelled 30 minutes and was really worth it

Poppadoms, mango chutney is great

We had chicken Karahi with naans and good portion sizes

Don’t forget to have their mocktails as they tasted amazing

Not only that staff was really friendly and attentive

Price wise very reasonable and affordable

For two people cost no more than £35 for what we ordered.

Atmosphere is great with great music in the background

Lastly when do you use warm hand wipe with a gentle scent of oud. First time eating here it was a lovely experience. Lovely decor and atmosphere friendly staff.

It was well cooked and presented, tasted delicious, too. Our server was lovely and nothing was too much trouble for her. The building itself was a bank, so the inside was beautiful, as you would expect from an old building. However, the leaves which hand around as decoration were very dusty and definitely due to be replaced/cleaned.

Food was nice and the menu had plenty of good options. We booked using FirstTable for 50% off food, so we got very reasonable prices as well. We didn't get any drinks, but there was a wide variety at the bar.

Overall, highly recommended! Been here before years ago on a friday night when it was lively and heaving. This time I visited during a quiet daytime.

It's a striking place to be in terms of decor. They serve some fantastic beers on tap, and are also good for a coffee. They made my wife a lovely cappuccino.

Great location, right in the city centre, minutes away from shopping centre or restaurants. This is a lovely place to stay in a great location. The hotel itself is decorated in what I would describe as ""old money"" style - nice and clean and in places expensive looking but in other ways it can seem dated, but that's just a matter of opinion. Never the less, I cannot fault it. The staff were lovely and the room was immaculately clean. Our bed was very comfortable. Loads of wardrobe space. The bathroom was massive.
There's a bar inside the hotel but there's also Bacchus Bar downstairs - not part of the hotel but just in the floor below. Really interesting, different bar.
Parking was easy, we used the car park above Grand Central so it's literally a 2 minute walk through the station and across the road.
We weren't woken up during the night by other guests, which is always a bonus!
You won't need transport staying here. Everything is within walking distance. Staff were excellent, dining service was excellent. The breakfast was great.
Rooms were clean. The Decor was old school with Shinning vibs which is a positive thing for me. The room had no working AC which made the room very stuffy, thankfully they did supply a fan. And the view from my 333 room was original. The Hotel is in the Centre of the city so it's perfect for a city visit
I would stay again Great location right opposite main station. Traditional hotel, large room and shower so so powerful! You could tell it caused problems as small damage to floors but bathroom was ok, not the most modern but clean. Luxury bedding & pillows were lovely for a great nights sleep.
The staff on reception were very friendly, for breakfast not as. We waited a couple of minutes to be seated and four staff walked past us. They were busy but thought they could have said Good Morning and smiled to us but we were just ignored.- not great hospitality.
Breakfast was included, if you had a full English but some of the others items had a supplement (see photo)  which I thought was strange as products no more expensive. Maybe, they charged this so kitchen could concentrate on just a couple of items on the menu.
During the day, bar service was friendly and efficient.
Stayed just for one night and so very worth it for location. Location is amazing if you travel by train. It's literally over the road. The Room I stayed in was very compact.

Main thing is we enjoyed ourselves. This was our first time going to Toco Social.  We had no idea what to expect but the staff was friendly and very helpful from the time we arrived through to the time we left. Niala Salim went above and beyond to make this feel extra special for our grandson whose birthday it was, she arranged to have his photo on the screen in the booth before they played and it was amazing. The staff at the end of the game even went out of their way considering they were really busy to present my grandsons with the medals and ball and trophy’s we took with us. Thank you so much we would definitely come back again and recommend you. Been a few times now and always had a good time! Food was really good also and the service was great. Special mention to Rachel as she looked after us so well, nothing was an issue and made sure we had the best time! The staff were so friendly, a special shoutout to jada who made us feel comfortable and looked after us throughout the whole time. Excellent customer service, will definitely be visiting again. Had a really fun time here for my brothers birthday. I’m not a hugely into football, but really enjoyed myself. I would definitely recommend going. We had food and drink. Food was lovely.

Placed my order, asking if they had skimmed milk, and was told only semi-skimmed. OK, that was fine.  The server went on to make my drink, making a big show of going into the fridge for said semi-milk.   It was obvious they had none.  She then proceeded to use the full-fat milk on the side.   I pulled her up on this, she totally denied it, although I had seen it with my own eyes.    She then admitted it, telling me she had too much on her mind etc.   She did remake the drink using oat milk, promptly spilling it on the counter and on me.   This was no biggie, I guess, well, not for me,  I just prefer skimmed milk, but as I pointed out to the server, what if this had been a medical dietary need ?? An allergy situation, and she was substituting items, which could have been a dangerous situation.    She couldn't seem to grasp that people could have issues with items being substituted without them knowing what they were getting. I know this sounds petty over milk, but if you're serving food, drinks, etc, if the customer asks for a certain thing, don't lie. Allow the customer to change the order, don't substitute. It’s raining and all I need a nice coffee because of cold weather. It makes you feel so good. Strong, full of taste and well roasted. Great service by friendly staff. There were more healthy choice of breakfast but I need just coffee.
It’s small but still indoor and outdoor seating. I like the location just inside Moor train station which is a beautiful station as well like old Victorian style. Fast and good service, nice coffee, atmosphere like back in the day. Vast selection of food and beverages as well. Recommended Nice selection of food and drink.
The lady is friendly.

It is the only cafe at the Birmingham Moor Street train station.

I had sausage bap and matcha latte.

Definitely recommended.

Good place for getting some snacks and refreshments whilst awaiting train arrival. Art deco ‘old world’ train station cafe with lovely staff. Think Peaky Blinders meets Brief Encounter. Great coffee and tea but the sausage sandwich was less successful, suffering probably from being ‘kept warm’ too long the brioche (why? Excess calories and sweetness not required!) bun tasted a bit pappy and spoilt the sausage. It is a coffee shop with a historical look that takes you to way back of the clock. It may have limited space inside but every corner of it worthy of your time. Both inside and outside has a balanced environment. There were enough comfortable sitting spaces in both areas. The decor of the shop made it an interesting place to visit. The stuffs were helpful, kind and welcoming. There were a manageable queue. There is a lot of interesting option for snaks. Had one latte and croissant and I loved it. The small glass of champagne happen to be very popular here among others, must be a good experience to enjoy while waiting for your train in lazy evening. Enjoy 😊 A traditional station buffet offering a variety of hot drinks, soft drinks, beers, wines and spirits as well as sandwiches, cakes and light bites perfect for eating in, in its beautifully restored art-deco surroundings, or taking away for your onward journey. If I could leave no stars I would.

DO NOT ORDER TOO GOOD TO GO FROM HERE.The staff are rude and unhelpful.

My boyfriend and I arrived at 7pm to collect our bag and we were told there were none (we arrived at 7.04). They first told us to swipe which we were not going to do. They told us to cancel the order when it should be THEM cancelling the order. We have come away highly disappointed sending a complaint to Too Good Too Go in the hopes of getting a refund. They told us to come earlier but collection started at 7pm, train your staff on how to use Too Good Too Go ridiculous service.

It is unusual for me to forget a place, and that I couldn't see my review.
I guess it is my age.
Anyway it was some rather nice adverts on FB that made me want to visit last Saturday night. However I did notice that it had received mixed reviews but these never put me off a place. Most reviews don't tell you a fat lot anyway.
Parking isn't great in Harborne but we struck lucky with a space on a nearby side street. It's situated on the first floor, up a long flight and I didn't notice any provision for those with mobility issues.
Once inside it has a very nice feel, although the trip to the loo let's the side down. The wife wasn't a big fan of the unisex cubicles.
It's licenced and the bar is well stocked however you can take your own alcohol but they will add a corkage fee which I think is a £1 per person.
It was quite busy and the atmosphere was very pleasant, relaxed and somewhat respectful which makes a change. The service was pleasant, quite a few staff but some were more engaging than others.
The food was excellent, and I couldn't find fault. I noticed some reviews mentioned bland but our starter and both mains were just the opposite.
The shared sheekh kebab was very nice, it could have done with a few more seconds in the microwave but it was very tasty and quite large.
The chicken Chetinad and a chicken curry were hard to tell apart until you tasted them. The Chetinad although a 'thinner' curry than I would prefer had layered spicing more typical of Indian style cooking than Bangladeshi.
The sides were excellent, especially the naan. None of that tricolour pilau rice either. The chips were good, could be better but I would say that for all but one 'Indian' restaurant in the Midlands.
I thought the bill was surprisingly good taking everything into consideration and I would be more than happy to go back. First time we tried it.  food was not to the quality.  very bland. The food is top notch, service is friendly and attentive. The lamb balti has plenty of nice big chunks of tender lamb. Be aware they garnish everything liberally with fresh coriander which isn't to everyone's taste so be sure to ask them not to if you don't like it. Amazing food and great value u for money and great atmosphere and great customer service all round This place now deserves one-star rating; the food was nice once; I'm not sure if the chef has changed.

Even though it’s a fish and chips shop, his chicken and meat options are extremely tasty 👅. Great service by the employees and the owner said it’s halal and gave us extra food. Portions are more than enough per person, almost unable to finish it with how filling the food is. Have went to the place multiple times and it never gets old. This is the best chippy in Harborne, as far as I know it's the best in Birmingham. Good value, fish battered excellent, superb chips too. Kebabs offered are also nice and the pizzas are good too. Honestly it's hard to choose what to order, they have good options. I think the cods scallops wish they were Gabriel's, or should do. Great business providing generous portions of chips I think.

Oh and the tartare sauce and lemon with the fish is excellent Greatest chip shop of all time!

Been coming here for about 6 months now and genuinely wouldn’t be able to go anywhere else.

The large haddock is always freshly made and absolutely perfect! The quality of the food is world class and you won’t get better in Birmingham! Gabriel’s Pizza, Fish & Chips in Harborne is one of my favourite spots to eat. The food is really delicious and full of flavour - everything I’ve had so far has been fantastic. What makes it even better is the great value. You pay a low price, but the portions are big, definitely more than what you'd expect for the money.

The owner, Mr Gabriel, and his staff are always friendly and professional. They treat customers with respect and make you feel welcome every time.

I really recommend this place if you want to enjoy tasty food and a good experience. You won’t be disappointed! BEST CHIPPY in the world? Could well be!
I absolutely love the chips here at Gabriels. Why? Well it starts with the easy parking despite being at the top of the busy Harborne High Street. With some spaces on the road and additional spaces on the car park (just remember to enter your car reg on the tablet on the counter in the shop!).
Then the actual shop is very smartly presented and clean. You can even see the food being prepared and your order being made out.
The staff are so nice and polite that you feel you stepped in your own kitchen. And they dress clean and tidy which is so important for me.
But the food is where it is actually at. The chips are without doubt the best I have ever had and I have eaten all over the world. They are the best potatoes for sure and they are cooked to perfection. Neither undercooked nor overly heated. And they are always fresh. Never reheated either.
I just couldn't resist in putting my box of chips on the ground outside the shop to capture a photo of the delicious chips today.

I'm not really sure what people in see in this café because for us it was a disappointment.
We visited on a Saturday afternoon right after Christmas. We ordered a cappuccino, a latte and a sausage roll each because there were hardly any cakes left.
The coffees were very disappointing.
My latte was very small, and also was quite tasteless with the cappuccino not being much better.
We ask for the coffees to be extra hot and they were served more like lukewarm.
The sausage rolls were also very disappointing
with rubbery pastry, and the sausage meat was very greasy and chewy.
I also find that the staff had an couldn't care less attitude. It's a shame it's not possible to give a 0 star review, because I would.
Next time we are in the Jewellery Quarter, we shall go to the Greggs opposite the clock tower instead and avoid this expensive rubbish. The manager was friendly and the coffee and fresh orange juice was nice. The fish finger sandwiches were really disappointing - more like fish cake fingers dripping with tartare sauce. A messy eat and not very pleasant. The food was good, but the sheer audacity of the staff member on the till ruined the experience.

Lovely airy atmosphere with a great menu.

We both went for a fresh juice mine was the energise one with kiwi , apple and spinach,  and a matcha latte.

For food we both chose the French toast with ice cream and berry compote.

When everything arrived it tasted fresh and perfect. We spied other plates going out and they too looked flawless. If I had the room I would have also ordered one of their stunning cinnamon buns too.

Overall highly recommended this place for breakfast/brunch . I visited Lovelife for brunch on Saturday and absolute loved it from the second I walked in! The internet first of all is super pretty and refreshing, I especially loved the bow details on the chairs and even took pictures!!

For the food I ordered the salt beef cubano, which was really delicious but I did wish it could have a little more sauce (a personal preference!). My friends also really enjoyed their dishes, like the full breakfast and the avocado toast. Everyone serving us was super friendly and welcoming, like the lady who took our order and told us we could ask for drinks not on the menu and Fatima who served us our food and told us how it was all freshly made that morning!

Will definitely be back for more!! Thank you for a lovely meal and ice cream! I recently went for Brunch with my friends at this cafe and the service… 10s across the board!! We were late for our reservation by around 10 minutes but there was no fuss when we walked in we were taken straight to our table. We already had a look at the menu online before so we knew what we wanted so we ordered (kitchen for brunch was closing at 2:45) and everything came out soo quick!!

Now where the service really excelled was in the staff. I didn’t get the name of the really lovely girl taking our order but if you suggested the whole ice cream, olive oil and sea salt combination (I haven’t tried it yet but I will!!) just know you really went above and beyond for us that day and we all really appreciated it. The bartender even made me a custom ice tea (which I definitely think should be a menu item because it was DELICIOUS). Another staff member called Fatima also told us that all dishes are freshly made each day like the focaccia bread we were having, and all the dishes are halal too!

The vibes were truly immaculate at this place, such cute interior design it was perfect for a hot summers day. They were also selling (quite big) ice cream cones for only £1.50 with your choice of sauce and toppings?? I mean if you haven’t been sold on the food and staff already at least come for the ice cream.

All in all, I definitely recommend this place for a brunch with anyone. But also I’m planning to go for tapas and sunday roast  too as recommended by Fatima because this place can do no wrong in my eyes, it deserves its flowers and I’m regretful to not have tried this place out sooner. I wanna do the opposite of gatekeep with this place l, everyone should try this place out at least once in their lives :) It is a beautiful place with lovely skylight that lets sunshine in when it's sunny in the UK.
Food was yummy and fulfilling
Shout-out to Fatima who gave the best recommendations and provided topnotch service.
Their matcha is a winner! I love going to a space where the decor is beautiful and where the space feels great. We had a lovely time at Cafe Lovelife, food was great, service was great, a little slow but as soon as the team noticed we were missing a few bits, they checked it out for us.

They deserve more customers. 👏 I never post reviews but I was so happy when I heard these guys were coming to the Jewellery Quarter. I never forgot how delicious the food was when I went to the Kings Heath one before moving. Been there twice in two days this week already! I love charcoal grills. These guys know what they are doing and it’s great food at really good value. Amazing service. Wonderful staff. Air con was a welcome treat during this hot weather we’re having. Chilled atmosphere and nice space between tables. Had already finished my food before deciding to take photos. Can’t wait to go back already. Was walking down jewellery quarter with my family and spotted this new cafe! Decided to have Turkish breakfast with my family, absolutely beautiful! They bought out a full platter along with Turkish breads and a plate of Turkish goats cheeses!

The atmosphere of this cafe made me feel as if I was on holiday and the owners were so lovely and welcoming, they stopped by our table to speak with us. Such a pleasant experience, I will definitely be back again to visit. Absolutely beautiful food! 10/10 service too! Will definitely be coming again! I’ve been to this newly opened place in our neighbourhood twice. The Turkish breakfast was excellent. You wouldn’t find one this good even in London, and the prices are very reasonable. The second time, I went with my colleagues from work for lunch and we tried the chicken doner, it was incredibly fresh and tasty.

The food and service are very good here, I've never been overly indulgent when it comes to Italian cuisine but when eating here me and my cousin always overorder but finish the lot, each time we come our bill is always over £140 as we do like to try a bit of everything.
No regrets BTW.

The pasta dishes are perfectly flavoured and if you have any meat dishes, they are top-notch with very little to critique from a negative POV.

The restaurant's decor is lovely, you easily feel at home here with it being decorated sympathetically.

The only negative I had was this visit we were seated upstairs, it was lovely up there but very quiet. When we got seated it was only us on the whole floor and (at a guess) with seating for probably at least 60 diners.
It did have a few tables through the night but was very quiet up there which is not what we're used to.
But hey, I'm seriously picking minor details up here.

Overall a solid night out at this place with a cracking environment, staff and most importantly food 👌

Thanks again and see you in December An excellent classic Italian restaurant in luxurious surroundings, tucked away by St Paul's Square. I have dined here for over a decade, and it still remains one of the best Italians in Birmingham, and rarely has it faltered. The food is superb and the choice of wines is very reasonable. I opted for a linguine monkfish and prawn dish - incredible flavours. A cosy Italian spot with friendly service and a welcoming atmosphere. classic dishes done well, with a few standouts. The tiramisu was a highlight: light, creamy, and full of flavour. There’s a good range of options on the menu to suit most tastes, from pasta to pizza and more. Service was attentive without being intrusive, and the staff made us feel very welcome. A solid choice for a casual Italian meal. Would return for the tiramisu alone! I've been coming here for over 20 years, my favourite Italian restaurant.  Food always tastes great and homely. Service is exceptional, and prices aren't excessive.  Love the seafood options Update: went again after a year. Maybe we were unlucky but food was tasteless and service was nice but not as good as before.

However even if you just pet a few particular cats, they scratch you or attempt to do so... perhaps an age restriction might be good, because we noticed multiple children who made the kitties look quite frightened. Besides that the food tastes amazing and the staff are very accommodating (thanks)! There are SO many brilliant choices on the menu, it was difficult to decide🐱 To be honest, since I moved to the UK last September, I’ve hardly had the chance to see any cats at all. I’m a proper cat lover, and up in Leeds where I live, it’s really rare to come across one, let alone get to play with them. So visiting Kitty Café in Birmingham was honestly like a dream come true.
I loved every moment of it – being surrounded by such cute, friendly kittens brought back all those memories of playing with them back home. The cats here are absolutely adorable, and the staff are just as lovely too. Guess it’s true what they say: people who love cats tend to be really nice/adorable, haha.
And at just £8, it’s an absolute bargain for such a lovely experience. Definitely worth every penny. Next time I’m in Birmingham, I’ll be sure to pop in again for another cuddle. I really do love cats so much! 🐾 Visited the Kitty Cafe today, great little spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat whilst in Birmingham. There were over 20 cats to interact with, The team were very focused on animal welfare with a set of rules in place to make sure the cats are kept safe and happy. The decor was pretty cool too & the cats had a lot of space to move around. I took my niece for her birthday and we had a lovely time. The staff explained everything really well. We had some food and cocktails while we sat in the cafe too. We saw lots of different cats; some were more friendly than others. The kittens were very playful! The cats seem well looked after, and the staff were really nice. The girl who served me was lovely, and she let me change tables when I asked. Nice honeycomb chai latte too.

It was indeed a master class by the owners and their staff who really care about their craft. From a reputational perspective for Birmingham they are also championing independent traders in a sector dominated by corporate blandness. We all got to make delicious cocktails and pizzas and walked away with the knowledge to make both better in future 😋 If you're thinking about a gift, giving knowledge of culinary life skills is about as good as it gets 💯 As pizza lovers we have been to lots of pizza places, but since discovering Smoke & Ash we don't go anywhere else. They have always been so warm and welcoming, especially with kids, and of course the pizza (gorgonzola and pear all time fave) and cocktails (chilli and yuzu margaritas please) are stunning.

The above led us to approach them to ask if they would host a small wedding reception for us and our nearest and dearest (around 30 people) which Clare and Paul accepted enthusiastically. They were so easy to work with especially in the run up to our big day, nothing was too much trouble and they absorbed much of the stress that comes with planning any event let alone your own wedding.

When it came to the day, the room was decorated beautifully (by Sophie I believe) and everything from the food to the service was flawless. The staff were so genuinely kind, relaxed and accomodating which created a lovely atmosphere for our celebration. We even arrived a little earlier than planned and this was no trouble at all. All of our guests (including vegans and other dietary requirements) were catered for perfectly and have all vowed to visit again.

Clare & Paul were also kind enough to also let us use an extra (also spacious) side room for the kids and even brought out toys etc for them to play with. This was something which meant we could really enjoy ourselves without having to occupy our very busy 2 year old!

We have never experienced such good hospitality and would highly recommend not only eating at Smoke & Ash once a week for the rest of your life, but also booking them for any similar gathering you might be planning. Thank you everyone for a perfect day.

Eve & Vicki What a beautiful pizzeria! Visited Smoke + Ash for a birthday meal. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived, generally the feeling inside is relaxed and friendly. Kids meal-deal margherita pizza was a big hit (a generous size to feed hungry children). Adults went for the deli charcuterie board, Bresaola cured beef pizza and the daily special pizza (asparagus and ham from memory). Food was fantastic. Drinks were great. Followed it all up with kid's ice creams, stole a spoon of my wife's chocolate + pear tart, which was delicious. Can't comment on my own dessert (panna cotta) as kids asked to try and then ate it all. Guess it's a good reason to return. I highly recommend Smoke + Ash. We had a wonderful experience at Smoke + Ash. Finn provided outstanding service from start to finish: attentive, friendly, and professional throughout. His approach truly elevated our afternoon. Highly recommended! One of, if not the best in Brum. Service is always bang on, menu is always creative and the drinks are up there. The restaurant has a lovely ambience to it throughout the day and they’re so accommodating with kids with their great selection of toys.

Plenty of options for vegan/ vegetarian diets. We came here for dinner not realising it was part of a building with a different name but it's in the corner anyway.

The service was lovely and attentive from beginning to end with some nice food choices at reasonable prices and good portions.

We chose beef cheeks, chicken supreme,  prawns , goats cheese salad, mussel croquettes,  garlic flatbread, potato bravas,  scallops,  meatballs I think that's it lol the weaker dish was unfortunately the prawns as didn't pack a lot of flavour or mussel croquettes time you scraped the contents out the shell there was not much.  The cheeks and chicken were the highlight

We did share a sangria but the flavours leaned more on the mulled wine side for me.

Overall it was a nice ambience would return. Great food, even better service!

Ordered one cheese board and one Meat board for about 19-20£ each expecting that would fill us up. Previously have gone places and got a decent amount of food. when complaining about the amount of food given they told us it was all locally sourced. However, if this is true we would personally want to be educated on where it is sourced and be educated on this, as when going cheddar that was what happened. However, the cheese and meat seemed to be poor quality as seen in picture and was thinly sliced which does not seem to be high quality, seemed more like a processed meat selection. It also did not state this anywhere on menus or walls ect. When we complained they also pushed back saying they understand we are students but we looked at the menu beforehand and was looking at spending about £20 each as was my birthday meal, and that was not the point of why we were upset with our food. Left feeling very underwhelmed and disappointed. Seems a steep price for what you get as no information shared, the board didn’t seem a really quality and you got about 10 slices of meat for £20. It also stated it came with crackers but i can’t see any on this picture. service was good as told us nice wines and made recommendations however when we complained they did nothing about the situation and pushed back with reasons we were not informed on We recently visited Tapas Deli and had an incredible experience that we just have to share!

We stayed for a couple of hours and got to play pool, curling, 2 games of bowling and darts. But you could also do karaoke, the virtual playground and ping pong too. Not sure how long the offer is on for but would recommend it. I imagine at weekends and evenings it would be more difficult to get around all the activities so quickly, as when we visited we didn't have to wait to do a different activity. The place was clean and staff were really friendly. Could've been better with having the music a bit louder as was a bit quiet on the bowling lanes and some work was being done on one of the areas which was a bit off putting but overall, really fun and good experience! Not so great to be honest starting with the arcade very overpriced not many games for example £2.50 for connect 4 I didn't even know so I stupidly just played against a robot who the hell would want to do that overpriced.. like 5 pound to play connect 4 with someone is INSANE dont drop money on most of those games.. pls

Then regarding drinks like £4.35 for coke pint etc and not fastest service. No order for how to get to next game jus waited in que even after booked time but thats fine since it wasn't so busy.. prob for a reason hm

The games.. gunshow was so BAD i actually thought we'd be shooting a real kind of gun but it was on a screen that was the worst thing ever.. not good at all, others next to us seemed to be playing a different game aswelltoo, weird.

Shuffleboard was okay first time doing took some time but was just okay.. but YEAH I  DON'T recommend coming here tbf. 😶!! I've been coming to this Lane7 regularly to play on the dance machine - Pump It Up: Phoenix - on my own and with the rest of the Pump It Up community.
Initially, we weren't too happy with the machine as the pads were under-sensitive and it was offline. However, after speaking with the general manager Ryan and the technician Damien, they were very happy to address our issues! They have been nothing but helpful and accommodating to us and that is a rare occurrence these days. Now the pads are great and the machine is online.
Many, many thanks to Ryan and Damien! Would definitely come here again, had so much fun. It’s best to come with a small group of friends of 3/4 as most games in the playground are only up to 4 players but for darts, bowling, beer pong and many more, big groups can come. The games were really fun and it was decently priced. We chose 30 mins playground and 1 hour darts which equated to £18 each person so pretty decent. The drinks however are pricey and rubbish. The drinks in the picture are non-alcoholic and it’s absolutely terrible and pricey for its size. Won’t waste money buying mocktails for non drinkers or Muslims. Just buy soft drinks Just wanted to say myself and my cousin had the best time!! The environment was buzzing.
- Hospitality was 10/10.
- Staff who served us were accommodating.
I don’t know if it was the owner who looked after us but he did a great job taking care of us when we did bowling and karaoke. We had a few good laughs with him too (‘fish’).
100% would recommend to family and friends!!
We will definitely be back to try out the activities we didn’t have time for.

Thank you!!

Price is not cheap but won't let you down with food. Portion is big for pasta. It is fun to have the pasta in three which is fun that you won't know what you get. We are too full and need a walk after.

It surprise me there is complimentary beard which is not common at UK. The food was very nice and fresh. The seafood linguine were very tasty. It was nice to be given bread and olives when waiting. First time dining at an Italian restaurant and it was amazing! It’s a great spot for date nights or catching up with friends.

The food was absolutely spectacular, see for yourself! I’ve provided pictures!

I’ll definitely be going back soon! We had a voucher to use from our sons (Christmas gift).
The food, service and atmosphere was really really good.
Was quiet when we arrived at 5pm and quite busy by the time we left at 6:45pm.
We had gamberoni and arrancini starters followed by lamb cutlets and Pollo Tagliatelle. Then room for creme Brulee.
Fantastic afternoon.
Prices are also fair for portion size and quality. Delicious food! They have a large selection of dishes and drinks. The staff is nice. The place can get a bit loud and it gets quite hot if you are seating inside.

The price is different to what it shows on the menu and told us it was the old price but when we look up on uber eats is not the same as what we charged for, very bad experience I always get food from here. Very well priced and tasty. After we arrived at the restaurant, there was no one at the reception, we looked at the menu by ourselves, and when we wanted to order their signature buns, they told me that they were no longer making them. We changed to fried noodles and some stir-fried vegetables, and then we waited for a full hour before seeing our food. During this period, some guests and deliverymen came, but no one greeted them. Many guests left after waiting for 4-5 minutes. I don’t know why a restaurant can have no signature food and receptionists, and it takes 1 hour to eat food, and the taste of the food really can’t calm our mood.

The Breakfast and Dessert Corner @ Rooster House is a rarity in providing a quality well presented breakfast at a very reasonable price. All six of us tried different items from the breakfast menu all excellent. The sausage, turkey rashers and eggs  cooked to perfection and  the spicy beans, waffles and hash browns elevate this to the next level. The vegetarian option was also delicious. The decor is a little more upmarket than your average cafe and very clean. Highly recommended. We came to this restaurant for breakfast but had a terrible experience. The staff were incredibly rude from the beginning. We placed our initial order, but when we realized we needed more food partway through, we politely asked to order additional items. The staff responded harshly, saying, “You should have ordered everything at the start—we don’t have time to take another order.”

When we asked for tea, a staff member turned around angrily and told us we would have to wait. When I inquired about their rude behavior, they simply replied that they were short-staffed and had too many customers.

I would strongly advise against visiting this restaurant.

Some of the food is pretty good and some of the food I have tried lacks a bit of flavour/seasoning and personally I feel the  prices are slightly on the higher end for what is offered.Service is friendly. I would still recommend the place for brunch/lunch as options are quite limited in the area. Love this place. We don't get there as much as I'd like. Food is fantastic, and great choices for everyone, including us vegetarians, coffee is divine. Would reccomend Kafenion to anyone and everyone. Prices are very good too. Lovely breakfast.  It was very busy today so we waited a bit longer but the service was excellent so we didn't mind waiting. Stopped by for an iced chai latte (which was delicious). The garden out back was such a lovely surprise with the sun shining, magnolia in bloom and a view of Cadbury. Inside was pretty busy and a little chaotic while I waited for my drink, I wasn’t totally sure where to stand or if I could wait outside. But hey, being busy is never a bad thing for a small business! All in all, a great spot in a great area! We popped in for brunch last Sunday - the food was fab when it EVENTUALLY came but the service was awful.
We ordered two of the grills and two hot drinks. Our drinks came pretty sharpish but after 25 minutes we started to wonder where the food was. The couple on the table next to us had theirs and they arrived a good 10 mins after us. We flagged down a waitress who never apologized for the wait but chased up our food - ""it's being plated up now""....20 minutes later we still didn't have our food. We flagged someone else down who immediately just said ""well it's busy isn't it"", not busy enough to stand and gossip round the coffee machine. We mentioned our drinks were long gone at this point and we were just getting annoyed. A further 10 minutes later and our food finally arrived, (55 minutes after we ordered), the lady didn't even speak to us. No apologies, no 'do you need anything else', 'any more drinks'. Nothing. Noone checked back on us and when we left, no one would make eye contact.
The food was absolutely delightful - it's just a shame I won't be back due to inpolite and rude staff members.

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly throughout our stay, particularly the restaurant team — their level of service was second to none and they really went out of their way to assist.

The room was comfortable and the location is ideal — just a 15-minute walk to New Street Station and the Bullring, with the Mailbox and central Birmingham attractions only a few minutes away on foot. The hotel itself is well maintained and clean, making for a pleasant base during our visit.

The only downside, and the reason for not giving a full five stars, was the lack of air conditioning. The room was uncomfortably warm and I struggled to get a good night’s sleep due to the heat. If this issue were resolved, it would be a near-perfect stay.

Would definitely return,provided the weather wasn't too warm. The consulate of Pakistan was chanting until 10:30pm at night. No air con (but they'll give you a thinner duvet if that helps). Very hard beds. No mini fridge, tea and coffee in the room is PG tips (no fruit teas). Had a bath in the room which was surprisingly comfortable. Overall a pretty okay hotel but nothing too exciting. We went to watch Peter kay and this was about an 8 minute walk from the venue the room was adequate  for two very clean  nice bed and good shower although when you turned the light on to the bathroom the vent thing made quite a noise but immediately turn off when you turned the light off the breakfast was fantastic, although the breakfast plates were stacked up and we went through eight plates before we found a clean one. Staff were very very good Saved us from a GIANT spider. Friendly Staff, No Air Con or Plug Sockets by bedside.

I was initially going to leave a standard 3* review along the lines of - ""The room was clean and the staff were friendly. However, there were no plug sockets by the bed, only 5W USB ports which was an inconvenience, especially since we only had USBC cables. There were two plugsockets under the TV so we could still charge our phones. The hotel does not have any cool air conditioning and it did get quite hot on the 4th floor, however there was a desk fan in the room and the option to switch the duvet for a cooler cotton one.""

That was until on the final night of my stay I spotted a GIANT spider on the wall. And I'm not exaggerating when I say GIANT, it was truly like something crawled out of an Australian nightmare. That spider was bigger than my hopes and dreams for the future. I don't know how many small children that spider must have eaten to get that size but trust me when I say it was massive. In a panic I ran downstairs to the reception to beg for help, my hair a mess and my pajamas tussled. They did not hesitate in helping move me into a spider free room at no extra cost. They didn't laugh at me, or dismiss my nightmare-fuel spider problem. They treated me with the utmost respect, professionalism and sincerity. Messy bed-head and all.

The immediate help I received, in the middle of the night no less, boosts what would have been a 3* rating to 5*. Any hotel that'll move you into a new room at 2am over a spider deserves a better rating than 3*.

(P.s The water pressure in both bathrooms was great! And they had cleanest shower head I've ever seen in a hotel) This premier inn is located in a lovely place just across from Gas street. The staff were very helpful, particularly a lovely person working in the restaurant in the evening.

Always showing professionalism along with engaging with customers with such respect and making us all feel so welcomed. Could not ask for anything else. Keep up the fantastic work!!! They didn’t even deliver my pizza (I waited 1,5 hours…) and I still don’t have any refund… This review is more to do with the chain rather than the franchise, though the franchise could also do better. We order for home delivery from Domino's often as one of the kids won't even try other restaurants. The ordering remains a very frustrating experience - there are so many deals, which really are not deals as no one would buy these 'full price' without the deals. The deals are confusing and  unlike other chains the best deal is not automatically applied. Would you believe that two small portions of side are cheaper than one 'standard portion'? The portion size of the sides are small, considering the price. The toppings are getting smaller over the years. The food sometimes arrive lukewarm. Overall not a lot of satisfaction for a lot of money. ordered pizza on a holiday, was marked as delivered even tho it never was. Waited over an hour for the pizza, called multiple times. When we were eventually put through they had just brought the order back because they didn’t want to call a foreign (irish) number. Eventually replaced the order after waiting 1hr 45 but it wasn’t a fresh pizza it was clearly the old pizza that had never been delivered brought back out. No refund or comps offered.

Argeelas - good name, good brand, good potential
Menu is simple
Service was efficient

The food for the most part was good
My only negative was concerning the portion size for certain plates.

I understand fine dining,
But 4 bite size prawns for eleven great British pounds is really poor.

That, plus the ‘wagyu’ burgers were really mediocre and did not live up to expectations nor justify the price tag. I was disappointed with said items to say the least.

Heaving said that, everything else was good.

I will be back to try other items it’s only fair. I did enjoy my night here. We will be back ! This place has amazing food, great vibes good music and the best shisha, It is definitely worth every penny, and when I tell you the food is just perfect everything is cooked to perfection.

Where breakfast meets bargain and the pints flow freer than the traffic outside.

Dropped into the Figure of Eight on a brisk Birmingham morning—Broad Street still yawning from the night before—for a no-fuss traditional breakfast. Verdict? Somewhere between average and actually-not-bad-at-all. But here’s the thing: for the price, it was more than adequate—it’s Wetherspoons, not The Ritz.

You know the drill: sausage, egg, beans, toast, and hash browns that could stop a hangover in its tracks. The coffee? Bottomless. Refill ’til your soul stops screaming. It’s a JD institution, like sticky menus and gents debating politics at 10am.

Now, let’s talk booze. Cheapest in the land. You could build a pyramid of pints for the price of a single cocktail elsewhere. And there’s something comforting about that classic Spoons setup—wooden booths, sticky floors, and a drinks menu as thick as a Dickens novel.

In summary:
Not a culinary pilgrimage, but for a breakfast with caffeine on tap and change left over for a cheeky morning lager, the Figure of Eight does exactly what it says on the tin. And then some.

Rating: 7/10 – mostly for the price, the bottomless brew, and the familiar Spoons charm. Enjoyed their breakfast hospitality. Absolutely spot on. This has set me up for the day.
Oh, special mention for the Benghazi, on the same floor. No staircase required. Boom! Warm chocolate fudge cake is really tasty and not too sickly sweet like you can sometimes get at other restaurants. Service was fine but check your cutlery as when I got mine the spoon hadn't been cleaned properly and was just gross. Dirty table, nobody bothered to come round to wipe our table after requesting this at the bar. Food was not enjoyable, not even average. On the plus side, it looks quite a nice place and could be just that with a bit more effort and better food. And Strongbow is back which was good. But  I' ll gladly pay more somewhere else going forward. A nice restaurant with a wide range of food choices and dining areas, all in one premise. Unique, one of its kind.
Food is good, fantastic taste. Service is good.
Free refills of soft drinks and beverages if you order with drinks.
Prices are affordable.
A comfortable place to wee the hours away. You can choose to read a book or get online on your notebook and even play a slot machine.
You can dine in the in house air-conditioning area or at their open space backyard.

A big thank you to Sakshi for her amazing service. She was super friendly and bubbly, and took the time to explain the dishes to us in detail, which really helped us choose the perfect meal. Her warm and cheerful attitude made the experience even better. Great food, great staff. highly recommend! The service at this Hyderabad wala Birmingham restaurant was extremely disappointing, and the staff was impolite. I ordered fried piece biryani, but instead, they served a dish with a tomato-flavored gravy and cold chicken pieces. When we explained the issue to the waiter, he dismissively insisted it was fried piece biryani and told us to eat it, claiming it would taste nice. I’ve never encountered such an unprofessional response.

Additionally, the family dum biryani we ordered for our group was served cold, completely lacking in flavor and hygiene. As a Hyderabadi, I know what authentic biryani should taste like, but this was utterly disappointing. They couldn’t even manage to serve hot food, let alone focus on taste or quality. I seriously question how this restaurant meets food hygiene and safety standards.

I strongly recommend avoiding this place. It’s a waste of time and money, especially given their poor hygiene and substandard service. Great food🤤 Apollo fish is a must try. And the Rice Kheer was 💯. Table service is also great. Overall a good choice if you want to try Hyderabad food and Indian food mostly. Such good food and such good service. Cute small restaurant with amazing South Indian food. Highly recommend. We came with 22 people for my friends birthday and had a great time. Licked Clean My Plate - Just wanted to share my thoughts on a few dishes I’ve tried so far at Hyderabad Wala — figured it’s finally time to write a little something.

Chicken Dum Biryani – hands down 10/10. If you like your food spicy (like I do — the spicier the better), this place hits the spot. You can actually talk to the restaurant about the spice level, which is great. The rice was super fragrant and packed with flavor. I usually only have biryani every few months, but in the last 3 weeks alone, I’ve already had it three times here. That says something!

Tried the Chicken Liver with Tandoori Naan today — wow. It was amazing and honestly made me a bit homesick. Haven’t had liver since I was back home, and this took me right back. So good.

Then we had the Masala Chai — it comes in a smaller cup than I’d usually go for, but considering the price, it makes sense. Plus, it was really good! Totally recommend it after your meal.

The vibe at the place is great, and the service has been one of the best I’ve experienced in Birmingham so far. It gets pretty busy in the evenings, but it’s super chill during the day — perfect if you’re looking to grab lunch and maybe get some work done (I usually catch up on emails there).

Our food and drinks arrived really quickly, our food was amazing, we haven't tried Vietnamese food before, it was absolutely delicious, we'd love to try more. However not sure we would come to Pho though. We waited ages for someone to ask if we had finished or would like anything more? A member of staff did take time to converse with lunchers at a table next to ours (we were behind him though), he did smile and mumble something before going back to counter/kitchen area. And so we waited quite a while to catch eye contact with a member of staff to bring our bill. In conclusion, we loved the food and drinks, very disappointed with the (non/slow) service. Its a pity the potential it there, great location, speedy food delivery, lovely tasty food and drinks. Please try a little more, take pride. Our dining experience was amazing.

From the moment we walked in without a reservation, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality. The staff went out of their way to ensure we were well taken care of, making us feel like VIPs throughout our visit.

Now, the food – absolutely fantastic! Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. The quality of the ingredients really shone through, and you could tell that a lot of care and attention had been put into every plate. Whether it was the starters, mains, or desserts, each course exceeded our expectations.

The service was attentive yet unobtrusive, with the staff providing helpful recommendations without being overbearing. It's rare to find such a perfect balance of excellent food and top-tier service. I would highly recommend Fumo to anyone in the area – whether you're a local or just visiting, this restaurant is an absolute must! We’ll definitely be returning. I had a terrible dining experience at Fumo by San Carlo (Waterloo Street, Birmingham). I ordered the lobster pasta, and it was absolutely awful. The lobster meat had a very strange taste—dry, rubbery, and completely unpleasant. It was nothing like fresh lobster or even decent seafood. Honestly, the dish was barely edible.

When I raised the issue with the manager, I was met with a shockingly arrogant and dismissive attitude. He flat-out refused to explain anything or acknowledge the problem, showing no interest in customer satisfaction at all.

This place pretends to be upscale, but the food quality is poor and the service is even worse. I strongly advise everyone to avoid this location. There are other Fumo branches in Birmingham—make sure you don’t end up at the Waterloo Street one. It’s simply not worth your time or money. Went to Fumo with my partner and honestly, I left pretty disappointed. The food tasted alright, but both of us ended up with stomach issues not long after, which kind of ruined the whole experience.
We ordered the pizza, and it was tiny. Like, ridiculously small. It looked like two slices rather than an actual pizza. Not at all what we expected, and definitely not filling. I left the place still hungry. To make it worse, the food was really expensive for what we got. The portion size just didn’t match the price at all.We also had the millefoglie for dessert, and that was another letdown. The puff pastry was soft and soggy, like it had been sitting in the fridge all day—not the light, crunchy texture you’d hope for.
All in all, it just wasn’t a good time. I don’t think I’ll be going back. Maybe if you’re just after a small snack or something quick with a drink, it might be okay—but if you’re looking for a proper meal, I’d say skip this place. Quick service, food is fresh and delicious. Service elevates the experience, servers care about your food and order. Food ordered in pictures: spaghetti with mussels, stuffed prawn pasta, and carbonara. Cocktails expensive but taste of value. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Fantastic Atmosphere & Great Drinks!
This place has everything you want in a great bar—amazing ambiance, skilled bartenders, and a fantastic selection of drinks! The cocktails are well-crafted and balanced, and they even have an impressive list of wines and craft beers. The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure you always have a great experience.

This is the second time I ate at this branch of Yakinori and I absolutely loved it. We were served by Hasan who welcomed us warmly and provided excellent service. I can see myself coming again. The food was absolutely delicious. I like how they provide various sauces to go with the food. I and my friend had an exciting time trying out eat item with the various sauces.

As a barista, I can see the coffees were not made well and the teas we ordered tasted like dirty water and were just warm not boiling. The atmosphere was nice as we just came from the movies but wouldn’t be ordering from here again. Called into Costa on Sunday to order hot drinks to go with our film, to get a double dose of inter-minority
microaggression. I waited several minutes, beside the till to be served, as both members of staff had their backs to me as they made the hot drinks for someone else. The female,  staff member then walked towards the till, just at the point that a woman arrived beside me to also wait in line. Instead of serving me, she began to serve this whiter, lighter woman. I told her excuse me I’ve  been waiting to be served (as though this needed some explanation for my waiting by the till) and this staff member rolled her eyes, as though I was an inconvenience for asserting my rights. To add to this, the other customer afterwards began glaring at me! It was Luke, the manager, arriving afterwards to work out, diligently if the hot chocolate powders were vegan, that has made this experience less bitter. I’m so tired of having to decide whether to raise a complaint and be seen as an angry, Black/Brown woman causing a fuss or just ‘compartmentalise it’ and go about my day. I chose the latter.  From this experience, I’ve decided to use Google reviews to call out racism wherever and in whatever form, I experience it. Refurbished Costa in Odeon Luxe. Go here before a film. Also next door to a rock climbing place. They scan Costa card separately. The new look is nice better than the old look. Understaffed, not trained and take ages to do anything. They work like they’re on holiday at this place, I’ve never been to a Costa, Starbucks or anything where it’s taken so long just to get one cup of coffee. The kitkat frappe wasn’t even mixed properly, could taste all the powder at the bottom of the drink. Absolute rip off for a terrible service. Sadly our experience in the store left us astonished, we were out having treats and hot drinks as a family  and there is an access way to walk to oden cinema, hubby literally told repeatedly several times by a staff member to keep kids under control.

The energy in the venue was electric from start to finish. The music was on point — a perfect mix of current hits and classic tracks that kept the dance floor packed all night. The DJ knew exactly how to read the crowd and keep the vibe going.

The staff were professional, friendly, and handled the busy crowd really well. Entry was smooth, drinks were served quickly, and the bartenders were great at making cocktails just the way you like them.

The lighting, sound system, and overall setup were top-tier — you could tell they’ve really invested in creating a high-quality experience. Whether you're out celebrating or just looking to have a good time with friends, ""Be at one"" is definitely the place to be. Wow, this place was great, good job it was 2-4-1 thou. We called in early evening, 6 oclock'ish and it wasn't too busy but within an hour it was filling up. The staff including the doormen were friendly and welcoming. The cocktails were presented very well and tasted sublime. So onto my big question would I go back? That'll be a big YES I would like to share my bad experience at your establishment. During my last visit, a barmaid was particularly unpleasant: she spoke in a curt and impolite manner, without taking the time to listen to customers or respond properly to their requests. We clearly felt like we were intruding, as if we were a nuisance. This lack of respect and professionalism seriously detracts from the atmosphere of the bar. It's a real shame, because the place itself has potential. I hope this can be taken into account to improve the welcome in the future.

In the photo is the person concerned. Booked for a hen do, service initially was great have 3 tables booked out. Girl on the door was amazing. However, one of our party ordered a cocktail, it tasted off and smelt awful, we spoke to two of the ‘managers’ that said it was fine, one tried it and said it was fine.

No replacement drink offered, the drink was undrinkable. Had to pay for a different drink. Which would have been understandable if she had drank the original, however was genuinely undrinkable. One of the ‘managers’ made a comment ‘we won’t serve sex on the beach tonight’ which suggests they were aware of an issue.

Considering there are 20 of us, the offer of replacing that drink would have kept us here We left our Booking early and won’t be back.

Appalling service.

The rest of the cocktails are drinkable but aren’t the best in Birmingham tbh I have so much love for Be At One new street, been here so many times over the years and will continue to come back.

We took the sharing desert board, which was sweet but not too sweet and beautifully presented. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Do try this little gem of a restaurant. **An Outstanding Dining Experience – Top-Notch Food & Service**

From start to finish, our experience was nothing short of exceptional. The food was absolutely delicious, and the customer service was truly first class – warm, attentive, and genuine.

We began with a generous serving of crispy *poppadoms*, accompanied by a delightful variety of chutneys and relishes – each sauce brought its own unique flavor, from tangy to sweet to spicy. A perfect way to whet the appetite.

For starters, we opted for the *Chicken Tikka* and *Papri Chaat*. The chicken was incredibly tender, marinated to perfection, and bursting with flavor. The papri chaat was a lovely mix of textures and tastes – crisp, creamy, tangy, and just the right amount of spice. Portion sizes were generous without being overwhelming.

Our mains included *Saag Chicken* and *Paneer Makhani*, served with freshly baked *Tandoori Roti*. Both dishes were outstanding – rich, flavorful, and well-balanced in spices. The saag chicken had a beautiful depth of flavor, while the paneer makhani was creamy and comforting, with a slight sweetness that paired beautifully with the spiced gravy. The medium spice level was spot on for us – just enough heat to excite the palate without overpowering the dish.

For dessert, we shared *Gulab Jamun with Ice Cream* alongside a cup of aromatic *Masala Chai*. The gulab jamun was warm, soft, and syrupy – complemented perfectly by the cool ice cream. The masala tea had just the right blend of spices and sweetness, making for a lovely, comforting end to our meal.

We’re regular diners at places like Dishoom, Asha’s, and Varanasi – and we can confidently say this restaurant holds its own among them. In fact, the level of customer service here may even surpass the others – the staff truly made us feel welcomed and valued.

Looking forward to our next visit – a new favorite on our dining list! This place is very very good. Nepalese/Indian cuisine. We had the vegetarian platter, vegetarian momo and chicken momos for starters all very well presented and super tasty and perfectly spiced. For mains we had one of the chicken curries and Palak Paneer again perfectly spiced and flavourful. The cocktails I’ve got to say are high quality and better than cocktail bars around the city. They are unique and masterfully made. I’d go back just for the drinks. I also had Cobra beer on tap too. To finish we had the dessert platter. Very well presented but the Jalabi and Ras malai could have been a lot better. I’m Indian and know my Indian food well so I feel that most people who haven’t eaten these types of desserts in the past will love them from here.

The star of the show was our waitress. Truly an amazing member of the team. Lovely and polite manner and very funny too and an absolute delight. She made the evening so much better and have to say one of the best waitresses/waiters we’ve ever encountered. She haloed us choose the right things based on what we told her about our tastes.  Her name was Hazel … well done!!! …and we will be back next time we’re in town. I recently celebrated my son's birthday and it was a fantastic experience! The ambiance is warm and inviting, with a lovely blend of Indian and Nepalese decor. The food was exceptional, flavorful, fresh, and expertly spiced. The staff went above and beyond, surprising us with a beautiful birthday cake for my son, which made the occasion even more special. The service was top notch, and we left feeling truly appreciated. Highly recommend this place for a memorable meal! Potentially my favourite restaurant in Birmingham.

The food is gorgeous, I've been here on 2 occasions and can't wait for my third. The restaurant is lovely, and staff are great, but the FOOD.

I’d even say going above and beyond whilst always having a smile on her face, both her and the manager (who I didn’t mange to get the name of) were amazing! Great work guys!

The salmon was fresh and flavoursome. Shame no Soft Shell Crab available which is the exclusive for Selfridges. The food is okay, you know what you're getting with a sushi chain. Sadly they didn't have a main ingredient that meant there were a couple of dishes I couldn't order. Staff could have been more attentive, I had to keep flagging them down to order more. It's a shame they didn't have the bells to ask for service like other yo sushi's had. Overall it's okay if you need a quick and easy lunch. Our waiter Jose was incredible ! He made our entire stay infinitely more enjoyable! He was very patient and helpfully even though we were a bit rowdy. 11/10 for the staff!!! The food is delicious but the portions were more on the small size. Flies in the Soy Sauce!!!!

1st time ever going to a Yo Sushi, took my wife there as she enjoys Sushi. She took a plate of the turn table and started to dig in, she added some soy sauce to her food and a small fly came out. Now 1 fly can be some what normal I guess but I turned my flash light on my phone and put it at the bottom of the soy sauce bottle and there was about 10 flies in there. Which now shows me they haven’t cleaned the bottles out in god knows how long! Yuk!! The waiter removed the bottle and brought us a new one but it wasn’t a trusted bottle after that. After she did take the 2 trays off our bill but it was very off putting being our 1st time there. Do I dare give Yo Sushi another chance? We wanted a quick and light lunch so we picked Yo! Sushi. Whilst the place is tastefully decorated, the food is rather disappointing. The flavors are not wholesome leaving more room for improvement. The sauces are typically central kitchen delivered sauces. The beef teriyaki is hard and over powered by the taste of shoyu. The curry pumpkin croquet has little flavor. The sushi rolls were mushy indicating that the rice has been over cooked.

A bit of Disco and karoake  made it a good mix. Will be going again. Not a large bar but does the job. Best to use public transport too.

When you leave, say goodbye to the other tables, even the ones you’ve just met, and hope to see them next time. A local treasure. Music is head-splitting and there’s no food.

One of the main courses was served significantly earlier than the rest, and the second only arrived after we reminded the staff—by which time my friend had already finished eating. While I really enjoyed the honey firecracker wings, the curries were underwhelming and not to our taste.

Given the pricing, we expected a higher standard, both in terms of food and service. Unfortunately, the customer service fell short. The general manager of the store was really professional and welcoming but our waitress seemed disengaged—she placed the food and change on the table without a word and didn’t check in with us at any point during the meal. There was no sense of warmth or attentiveness, which really affected the overall experience which left a negative impression overall. It’s a shame, as we were looking forward to the meal. We visited here Friday 14th around 1pm. The food was amazing, the drinks were great and the service was 5star.
We were served by Jack and he was super attentive and friendly, he made us feel extremly welcome and as if we were the only people he was serving.
He took my Moms allergies to gluten super seriously and explained everything they would do to cater to her allergies, which is great as she is always dubious eating out due to lack of care, which had made her ill, in the past.
Food was delicious and served quickly Visited today with my family and would highly recommend.  The food was excellent as always and the staff were very friendly and could not do enough for us (especially Karys).  My daughter has a nut allergy and staff were very helpful in making sure that the dishes she had chosen were suitable which was very reassuring.  We will definitely be visiting more often 😋 Lunch, very good rice bowl and noodles.
Kimchi perfect. Fast pay with QR code. Good service quite quick.

This was not a problem Miriam was excellent. Going beyond customer expectations in finding a solution. Payment made pizzas ordered and delivered on time to the QE hospital.

We were a group of 10. At the end they gave us the 700£ bill. The manager was rude and thick when we pointed out that we wanted to pay separately.

The waiting staff were all brilliant though.

Also. At the end, you get herded out. The waiting area is too small. You can't move because you're knocking into incoming or leaving people.

Nice food but I'd never return. Lovely pre-theatre meal.

Lovely staff, warm and welcoming.
Our son loved it and he doesn’t usually like anything other than chips!

The prices are very affordable considering it's at the centre of Birmingham.

Their fries are very nice. The kebab wrap and seekh kebab are alright. Haven't yet tried their fish, pizza, biryani, pilau rice or chicken karahi. Khans palace has been taken under new management and is now called LAHORE PALACE

Major improvements needed

They have limited selection and the selection is cold so they microwave the food to be hot.

The grilled chicken wings flavour was okay but they are such small wings it’s not worth the price.

It’s a new business and I’m sad to leave such a review but they need major improvements if they are to survive.

Simplify the menu and TASTE the menu. The lamb curry was not good or the rice - over laced with cardamom.

Advice: sort your menu out and maybe find a better chef because the food is not good. Smelly place, I ordered lamb curry with chapati. Lamb curry was extremely oily hot and bones only wasted my money. Very bad food. Came here after long time, they started Desi Breakfast, i had Aloo Paratah which was like homemade, freshly made, crispy from outside, nice potato filling medium spicy, full of flavour, a very good morning boost to wake up, also orderd tea (Doodhlatti) its was full of flavor and creamy 👌 If you're stuck for a place to eat in town look no further than this simple Pakistani Afghani takeaway grill shop.

The place is really organized and nice, but unfortunately you don't feel comfortable there.
When you enter the place you feel that all the workers are watching you Every time you move a worker comes next to you and pretends like he wants to organize something or checking something,
On top of that, it's very expensive. For example, I wanted to buy Peuneut butter, 50 grams or 100 grams i don'tremember exactly  they selling for £2.70. And everywhere else it's £0.90 or £1.10.

That's was my experience and my opinion. Have to say the staff in here are wonderful. Always on hand and so helpful. Store is always clean and neat but the main reason for this review is to praise the lovely people who work there. standing in a queue to use self-service till with nobody on the checkouts and staff cant be bothered to open a single till... poor service and not what I would expect from M&S I am really disappointed with M&S because they are tolerating behavior that supports discrimination. My friend accidentally blocked a white customer’s path with her trolley while checking out, and an Asian female staff member rushed over to scold my friend, calling her rude and even taking her photo. My friend was shocked; she couldn’t believe this action happened in the UK’s most expensive and largest supermarket chain, especially she is a customer.
This same Asian staff member also pretends not to understand your accent when you ask for directions if you’re Asian, claiming her English is not good, but then looks at you provocatively and leaves you alone, ignoring your question.

As the most expensive supermarket chain, I don’t mind paying more money than at other supermarkets, but I believe you should increase your wage budget. I suspect that the low wages are why you are unable to hire staff who can properly understand English. I doubt you can provide better service if your staff doesn’t have good English skills. An Asian female employee here is very unfriendly to Asian customers, even saying some very unkind things to Asian customers. I really don't know why MS can tolerate such people to work in their supermarket. I wouldn't recommend my friends to shop here because there is an Asian employee here who likes racial discrimination.",0.2,0.8,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

A few more carrots/parsnips would have been nice, I only had 2 pieces of carrot and 1 parsnip and roast potatoes could be improved they tasted like ‘aunt Bessie’s’ but overall a great experience. Came here on Wednesday evening with a friend for dinner.
Nice, cosy atmosphere and got a table by the fire.

We had the 3 courses deal each for 13.95 which I thought was a great price.

We had

Chicken wings
Breaded mushrooms
Lasagne x 2
Creme brulee
Chocolate orange sponge

All the food was really good. Loved the breaded mushrooms.

My only feedback is that the service was slow between courses. We had to ask for our dessert after waiting around 30 mins after finishing our mains.

So unacceptable and unhygienic. Lovely little place. Very tasty food, the cinnamon iced latte was the best coffee I've ever tasted. The portion size was definitely hearty and tasted really good. Cannot recommend enough.
Really pretty aesthetic and lovely staff. Loved it. I had been wanting to visit here for months, since I saw this place featured on a Rick Stein programme and, as it says on my profile, I am a lover of chai lattes so love to visit places where this is served. We tried to book a table but the email received to our request was non- committal to this and when I arrived, the server knew nothing of our booking. There was a table however and liked the vibe and look of the place. First the food, between the three of us we went for a desi breakfast, Shakshuka, halloumi hash and shared a loaded cheese fries (originally went for the loaded nachos but out of stock) All the food absolutely delicious and would return to try more dishes as really good selection of veggie food. However the disappointment was the chai! After discussion with the server of options, I ordered what I thought was going to be a pumpkin spice chai latte. Unfortunately when it arrived, it contained coffee which I absolutely can't stand or stomach!! I returned it and the server apologised and I was given a second drink. Despite my adding several sugars, this was completely undrinkable as very powdery and bitter. My third attempt at a drink was a standard masala chai, which I took away with me but to be honest, it was on par with the masala chai teabags I use at home. Food great and if you are not a coffee phobic like me, you will probably like the drinks but unfortunately I was disappointed with the chai drinks, which I had been looking forward to trying. Good: Food taste, quite big portions, location, environment.
Could be improved: We waited 20 minutes to get an Americano and a Chai Latte. And 30 minutes for avocado toast and jacket potato with beans. This establishment looked very promising, I went with 7 of my work colleagues for lunch. The atmosphere and decorations was very unique and beautiful for your Instagram posts.

The let down for me was I waited nearly an hour for my order, luckily my lunch break was not time limited that day. This could have been due to the lack of staff as I noticed there was only three people working. Yes it was lunch time but it was not busy until customers came in after our table had ordered. Some of the customers after us got their food before the whole of our table.

The chicken fried burger I order was just two chicken strips, salad and sauce. Don't know if my expectations was high by thinking I would get like a whole chicken breast piece.

I had a challenging experience at first due to some confusion around an online order and delays in delivery, but everything turned around thanks to Felix, the store manager at JD Sports Birmingham New Street.

Felix was incredibly professional, kind, and genuinely cared about helping me. After hearing that I had an international flight the next day and had already faced stress due to the situation, he stepped in personally, offered me a special discount, and helped me find exactly what I needed — all while making sure I left with my order on time.

His attitude and support made all the difference. This wasn’t just great service — it was a lifesaver. Thank you, Felix, for your outstanding help, and thank you JD Sports for having someone like him on your team. The service here is awful, would not recommend. This is a long review so buckle up. I already knew what shoes I wanted to buy when I walked in so I picked it off the shelf and asked for my size. He then gave the shoe to a different colleage and told me it would be 2 minutes. 5 minutes pass and still no shoes. I ask the person who took the shoe off me in the first place and he was like ""oh let me check"". Another couple minutes go by and I finally get given the shoes to try on (I'm between sizes and it varies brand to brand so I had to try them on) but for security reasons(?) I was only given one. I tried it on and it was slightly too large so I asked for the next size down instead. This time ANOTHER staff member when to get them and were gone a long time. Then after 10 minutes they saw me from across the room, gave the shocked pikachu face as if they forgot me and then held up 2 fingers and mouthed ""give me two secs"". After a couple more minutes I had the shoes and they put them behind the till. After waiting in line for what felt like an eternity, the cashier just felt rude and I was so done by that point I just wanted to pay and leave. Won't shop there again, lesson learned I guess. Came in a few days ago. My experience was horrible. The worker. His name is Imaad, kept asking for my number and would not stop following me around the store. Told a colleague who did nothing. Left and shopped in the bullring. Creepy men should not be working in a customer service job Kura deserves a promotion, she went above and beyond contacting customer service twice to help me secure a refund because the system was a bit of a mess. Thank you Kura for the outstanding service and getting my refund sorted even tho I had lost my receipt. That's what is called going above and beyond in customer service I hope you get promoted. As I Used to work in JD sports as a youngster back in 1996 I was Mortified at the service received what’s happened I spent over 120 pounds on two pairs of Junior trainers the lad who served me took an eternity to go to the small lift to get the trainers  instead wanted to joke about and act up with his work pals who looked liked thay get paid just to doss round a Till point

Eventually paying for the trainers the lady well girl should I say looked miffed because I’d come to buy and she had to stop laughing with her mate to serve me I say serve it was anything but she never said please never said thank you she literally said card ! I thought this has to be like a little Brittan hidden camera show or some joke where they all burst out laughing and say your on camera

She then said there’s a system era pay again not sorry or anything in the way of apology I had to ask on the sales assistant if or when I’d get a refund has two payments had come out my bank few days was her reply I loved the way she just assumed I’d have another 120 pounds two pay twice she handed my receipts and literally turned her back on me it was me saying thanks then !

Honestly I’d have lasted half a day back in my day with that sh** And then I’d have been walked out and said retails not for you what’s happening John , David sports do a mystery shop see for yourself,s what you paying these kids for ?

Still unresolved!

I visited this station on 20/04/2025 around 4:50 PM, filled up with £39.89 of fuel, and purchased a pint of milk and baby wipes, paying £42.40 in full through the service window (as the shop was closed).

Despite this, I later received a letter from a third-party company (ForecourtEye) claiming I had stolen fuel — an accusation based solely on the word of the garage manager. I have provided bank statements proving I paid the full amount, yet they continue to pursue me, refusing to supply any receipt, CCTV or breakdown of what was sold.

To make things worse, they’re claiming I purchased AdBlue, which is impossible — I drive a petrol Vauxhall Corsa, which doesn’t use it!

This experience has been stressful, damaging, and completely unfair. It reflects very poorly on how this forecourt is run, and I hope Shell and others take action to prevent this from happening to other innocent customers.

I would advise anyone using this site to keep their receipts and be cautious. I parked to charge my EV car for 1 hour 23 minutes, unfortunately I received a parking 2 tickets for overstayed while to charge my car to maximun is at least 1h30' for chargers unders 150Kwa I ordered a package from Amazon to be delivered to a drop-off point at a petrol station. The address was specified, and I went to collect my parcel between 1:00 and 2:00 PM on November 22nd. However, when I arrived, the staff informed me that I had to wait until they finished serving all the customers refueling their vehicles. They said their priority was petrol sales, and only afterward would they assist with Amazon services.

This is disappointing, as it creates confusion and poor customer service for Amazon users. If the petrol station cannot handle Amazon services effectively, they shouldn’t partner with Amazon. I waited for several minutes while multiple customers were served, and eventually, I got fed up and left without my parcel.

I wouldn’t recommend choosing this petrol station as an Amazon drop-off point, as they don’t provide satisfactory service to Amazon customers. Arrived to shell station after work at 22.30 to top up fuel, where I’m regular customer. The cashier didn’t opened tap for fuel and just staring at me, after said via microphone pay first. The door was locked to a store. True the window he said pay first then put fuel. I inform that able to pay by card or Apple Pay and I need to scan my member car first and he still insists to pay first. How I’m supposed to pay if not sure how much would car need it?
Definitely this is not the way you expect to be treating a young lady, who tired after work and looking to top up fuel before go back to work again in early morning. The same cashier served me many time earlier morning at 6:20am.
Was so hard to be more loyal ?

Videos were emailed to us to download after for no extra cost, it was also great to be able to watch back and laugh at ourselves! Will definitely be back again to try the different games! Excellent place. Went on a Friday afternoon. Myself and my son had a private game. The whole set up was brilliant. Game play really smooth. Even after using Oculus VR this was levels above. Totally absorbing game play. Robot cocktails were a fun element. The video at the end is next superb take away. Really well done We’ve been to a few VR venues before, but Sandbox VR Birmingham sets a whole new standard. The atmosphere is vibrant and stylish, and the drinks robot is cool,  the whole place is brilliantly put together.

We played five experiences during our visit and were blown away by the quality - the immersion and fun were next-level. Our favourites were Seekers of the Shard, Rebel Moon, Zombie Valley, and Zombie Phobia. We played with a ten-year-old in our group, and all of us players, 10-49, loved them.

Squid Games was enjoyable too, but for us, the real magic was in the teamwork, lore, and weaponry of the other titles. The level of detail and interactivity was unmatched. We’d give the game experiences the highest possible rating.

But the real stars of the day were the staff - friendly, professional, and enthusiastic —Kim, Surifan, Amina, Ben, Malcolm, and Gina deserve a special mention. They each brought warmth and attention to detail that made us feel completely looked after.

Most importantly, we were deeply impressed by the way Surifan and Amina supported a member of our group with an intellectual disability. They ensured their autonomy, dignity, and inclusion in a way that is far too rare. That kind of respectful, person-centred care is so so rare.

Kim’s oversight throughout was clear and intentional - this team is clearly running a tight, thoughtful, and caring operation. The attention to detail in both the technical and human aspects of our visit was evident throughout.

We cannot recommend Sandbox VR Birmingham highly enough. If you’re looking for an epic VR experience in a space that’s inclusive, fun, and expertly managed, this is the place. We’re already hoping for the chance to visit Birmingham again in the future so we can revisit.
Thank you very much.

(Loo picture included to show how inclusion is really thought out here) I was looking for a fun activity for me and my wife when I came across Sandbox VR Birmingham on TikTok. Booking was incredibly easy, and we decided to try Deadwood Phobia, a thrilling zombie survival game.

From the moment we walked in, we were warmly welcomed by the staff. After signing a quick waiver, we got to choose our in-game weapons, which added to the excitement. The VR equipment was comfortable—even as someone who wears glasses, I had no issues at all.

Once inside our gaming booth, the immersion was next level. It genuinely felt like we had stepped into a different world, battling zombies side by side. The experience was intense, interactive, and so much fun!

To top it all off, at the end of the session, they send fun video highlights of your gameplay straight to your email, which was such a great touch. Both my wife and I loved every second of it and immediately agreed we’d be back for more.

10/10—highly recommend! If you’re looking for a unique, adrenaline-pumping activity in Birmingham, this is it! I beat Keranthony Wheelang. I also liked the bar. The bar was good. Kim and Mahnoor were great behind the bar. Sianne was awesome too.

Lovely staff, spotless twin room, great breakfast with good variety for any taste (traditional British or lighter selections). Easy to find, close to railway. Enjoy a few games of American pool after breakfast before our departure. Would stay again if ever return to Birmingham) Honestly, THE best hotel stay for a city. From the moment I arrived everything was perfect. The staff are so friendly and accommodating, a massive shout out to Gerg (sorry for the spelling), she couldn't have been more helpful. The breakfast was everything and more that you could of wanted. The room was very calm and quiet, hot shower, comfy bed and all for an amazing price 🥰! I will definitely be back and spreading the word for this hotel. Hive yourselves a bow ! Conflicted with this hotel. The communal areas are well finished, the rooms are anything but.
Staff at check in and breakfast were really nice. Breakfast had an ok selection, but is a bit cramped.
Gym is quite small, but the equipment was all modern and working. Can't fit more than 2/3 in at any one time.
Rooms were really awful. Carpets were full of stains and looked threadbare. Marks and scuffs all over the walls. Walk in shower was really good. Just really desperately need a revamp.
No irons, only a handheld steamer which you need to sign out from reception. Where to start ha , I don’t normally do reviews but this place ! , first get there , no aircon, and then no irons in the hotel , so go to ask and they say they only have small numbers of steamers which all run out which not good at all, stuff don’t want be the at all , went breakfast and my room number wasn’t on there and he looked at me and like yer nothing I can do? , so after 30 second chat with reception it turns out they forgot my room, oh no parking either as it’s shut, smells of weed and hall ways , don’t go here just stick to any other chain hotel that will be better Seeing a band at the O2 so stayed here for convenience and was perfectly located. It exceeded my expectations. Room was basic but comfortable, slept very well. Staff were welcoming and helpful. The small things matter, even opening a new bottle of prosecco to pour me a glass because the old one was flat, and on checking out asking if we needed taxi's, makes a difference. The bar was fantastic, reasonably priced and we had a game of pool before the gig, also there was no air con, massive win for me, nice to be warm whilst having a drink and breakfast.

We went on Sunday at 4.00 pm. Food tasty and beautifully presented. Service outstanding. Venue nice and bright, a change from some dark, dingy and close Indian restaurants. They went the extra mile and really looked after us. Price, reasonable given we had 3 courses. We went here just yesterday for my husband's birthday and the owner and waitress were so attentive to all of our needs (16 of us may I add), including all my young nieces. The food was very flavoursome not over-spiced or bland like other restaurants, who think flavour doesn't matter. Everyone had a great time and the head waiter even sang happy birthday and brought the cake over for my husband. 5/5 highly recommend! Very cosy place in the heart of Jewellery Quarter, great atmosphere with even greater food, staff and owner are very nice and kind. It is slightly on pricier side, but no regrets on the food, especially when its one of a kind Nepalese kitchen around. Definitely would recommend to anyone to try at least once. Menu has a lot of variety, so anyone should find something to like. Stop, wait a minute, think, reflect. “Did I just experience something off the charts?” My mind was blown following a visit to Jojolapa Nepalese Bar & Restaurant.
The restaurant looks diminutive as you pass it by on the street. Enter and behold, this is no ordinary restaurant. JoJolapa’s interior queues matches its culinary intentions. It is best described as fusion: Nepalese meets Indian meets British hipster. The light pours in from the skylight giving the comfortable, lounging dining area an inviting warmth.
The service is exceptional, the concept of JoJolapa, it’s dishes and its soul are explained in detail. I recommend letting them guide you. Go on, try dishes that will open your chakra to a whole new world of food.
The pick of the dishes, for me, was the soya tikka biriyani. If I was to describe it better, it is a Nan topped rice and (Meat,vegetables,vegan meat) pie delivered with a side of curry sauce. What an amazing dish; I had to ask the serving staff if they’d accidentally served me actual chicken given how convincing the soya chicken was.
What an amazing place, the most exciting culinary experience I’ve had for a while. Wow, this place is a little jem, food excellent, cosy and contemporary. Staff so friendly, looked after us, our set meal for five was outstanding, and was totally refreshed as the dishes were eaten.

Working for this agency turned out to be the worse experience I have had in my entire life. It was traumatising and emotionally scaring. These are such disgraceful people to work for , as you are always disposable to them ,never theirs to look after . Stay away from their job assignments unless totally desperate for work. To give this a little context,  long story short, I`ve been employed by this company on a 6 months contract initially and then extended with claps and good feedbacks from those above, until 31st March 2025. Not long after the contract has been extended by Brook street client, due to funds being cut down their client no longer needed Brook Street agency workers. The client told me so straight forward no hidden agendas at the time and of course I insisted that the contract is honoured until the 31st of Match 2025 as agreed. Immediately after around Christmas period, they ( I refer to they as the company who hired me through brook street) started treating me bad and most of the time cold and ignorant towards me in an attempt to either find a reason to terminate my contract before term or to make me leave due to their awful treatment and so the fund cuts are met. I was constantly told that if I don`t like something or I have an issue to call the agency as I am not their problem. They where  constantly finding me faults I didn`t have before and most days I was given no work at all and then hoovered over and bubbled behind for `` being useless`` and not doing any work. I mention that work is distributed or assigned by a manager we didn`t just get in and pic whatever to do. I raised the (no work while some are overwhelmed with too much work to do) issue with one of the managers asking for work as other colleagues of mine were clearly overwhelmed, I was always offering to help others  in my team , but then again I was told to call the agency if I don't like it as I am not their problem. There was no kind communication from this employer anymore. After about 2-3 months of this sort of treatment and threats that if I complain it won`t be well  , they finally somehow found me to be in ``conflict of interest with them`` for a job I was planning to undertake after ending the assortment with them and when that did not work they pinned me down for other bits and bobs and and finally ended my contract on the day I wasn`t even there preventing me from collecting my belongings in a decent way anyone would expect to . I was refused entry to collect my belongings after 12 months there, out of the blue I was treated like a criminal. I never knew what working for a agency feels like , not being a direct employee to a company makes you their door mat ,this is modern slavery as agency workers most of the time are treated bad and not equal as initially presented so you accept the job. Agency workers remain in job after figuring out the details to respect their contracts or pay the bloody bills but for me this is a never again .

Update 20.03.2025  : Spoke with Louise at Brook street and I was told that unfortunately this is the way agency assignments end with notice but also without notice at all. If you get unlucky and your assignment ends, without notice on a day you are not at work, you get disrespected and treated like a criminal and whatever you had on the desk or drawers etc goes at the front door so you can get further disrespected when you go to collect them. Basically you get binned like you were nothing , and that is standard procedure of ending assignments with Brook Street.

Update 21.03.2025 : Went to pick up the box with my belongings that they decided to return to me to find in the box someone else's stuff , a pen of mine , a cup and a cardigan. The rest can be of use to them I suppose, that is straight thieves. That is not only disrespectful and disgraceful but it is an abuse. My personal belongings should've never been touched by anyone but me. Mr. Richard, I would like to thank you for your professional communication and action from the public services department. I would recommend Brook Street Firm, as a professional recruiters.
I am extremely delighted to work for Brook Street Agency. Agent Richard provides a surprisingly constructive viewpoint and solution to his concerns, as well as an empathic handling of the situation. I am grateful that I may confide in you about the challenges that have sadly surprised me in my family, and that Mr. Richard was willing to assist me. I sincerely thank you a thousand times. With profound regard for you. Thank you very much. After a 2 month emotional roller coaster 3 start dates 3rd date booked with confirmation email  to start work. The day before i am suppose to start email sent assignment cancelled and to be looked into.

Really never trust Brook Street again

Treat people like cattle

I aready sent over my evidence regarding this was told it would be looked into was sent the same email which basically says no work available

Your company has been doing this for years i have no time sending a email to you regarding this you already know

Took a knock on my mental health i am disgusted and your not sorry you got what you needed Really transparent employer, know exactly where you stand with everything.

Richard Samuels was amazing throughout my entire employment with Brook Street. From before employment, right through to the end he was on hand to help with any issues or enquiry I sent to him he would help or point me in the direction of someone who could assist. He gave numerous courtesy calls to update me on my employment process and was so approachable and understanding. He deserves all the praise and recognition possible! Waist of time. They call you and email constantly during the application process then when it comes to start date they send you email no explanation and the mose used words from the Oxford dictionary.

Title: Deeply Disappointed – Would Not Recommend

We were genuinely excited to host our wedding here, but the experience fell far short of expectations. The air conditioning in both the venue and rooms was completely inadequate — the unit was visibly dirty, leaking, and not cooling the space, causing our £600 wedding cake to collapse by the evening. This was especially frustrating as we had been told it would be fine if the room was climate-controlled — which it clearly wasn’t.

There was no proper duty manager after 7 PM despite prior assurances. When issues came up later in the evening — such as missing food allergy labels — there was no one clearly in charge to handle it.

The hotel stay was also a nightmare. We had to get our room keys sorted six times, staff seemed unaware of our bookings, and the room aircon didn’t work, forcing us to leave the balcony door open all night. Since our wedding, we’ve seen similar reviews which confirms these are recurring problems.

After the event, we raised all these issues and asked to escalate the complaint. Our request was ignored, and the response we received was dismissive.

A wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime occasion — and we left feeling let down, stressed, and incredibly disappointed. Based on our experience, we would not recommend this venue to future couples. When arrived we were told that they were having a problem with the air con. Reception made as if it was something that had just happened but apparently it has been going on for months. Rooms were so hot it was difficult to breathe let alone sleep. Non of the drinks I requested were available in the restaurant and when you went to the gents there were out of order urinals with buckets of piss underneath. Never again We had a lunch for two voucher, with a glass of prosecco each, staff were very friendly and could not do enough for us.
I had the liver parfait on sourdough bread to start with a wild berry and fig jam which was lovely , my partner had the roasted vine tomato soup which she really enjoyed , for mains I had the steak cooked blue which was gorgeous and melted in the mouth with fries and side salad and a bowl of pepper sauce, my partner has the chicken escalope which was very nice but a bit overcooked.
Overall would rate it a 8.5/10 the main room looked a bit tired and the service area needed a bit of refurbishment.
Would recommend a visit for an enjoyable meal for two. AVOID. As others have mentioned the hotel has zero air conditioning, despite being a totally closed tower block. This is not just a temperature problem, but the air feels very poor quality as there is minimal air exchange with the outside world.

The hotel accepted the booking weeks ago and only sent a notice of broken AC the night before our stay. When I saw the message I assumed it must have been a new/temporary issue but I have now seen lots more reviews raising this point.

Some reviews mentioning broken AC are from 1 month ago, 2 months ago - the one from 2 months ago mentions reviews from months before that!

Clearly the issue is known to the hotel, so they should absolutely not be accepting bookings.

I am not exaggerating when I say the hotel is uninhabitable in its current condition.

I will be reporting to the booking.com platform.

In the meantime I am still awaiting my refund...

Overall I am not surprised the HVAC system is in disrepair as the hotel is in a generally poor condition. This was a fantastic experience, the view from the boat was beautiful, especially of a night time with all the lights and view of the water. The afternoon tea was a lovely touch to this experience.

The staff was nice and attentive. The food was SO good. They have a very large menu with set menus, vegetarian options and more. The Mango Pudding we had for dessert was a bit too simple but definitely recommend all the rest. We shared a starter, got a main and dessert for around £20 pp. I had pork noodles, my wife had crispy pork with rice alongside Wanton Soup. With pepsi as the drink. The drinks were great 500ml in tall glasses. I liked my pork noodles, the portion is massive and it's best in buffet. I had to take it back in a doggy bag. The crispy pork was lovely too. My wife thought the wantons in the soup were not seasoned enough and it did feel.like this. The service was good and felt quick. I recently visited Chung Ying in Birmingham and was pleasantly surprised by how well they cater to vegetarians—especially when it comes to dim sum. As someone who often finds veggie options to be a bit of an afterthought at Chinese restaurants, Chung Ying was a refreshing exception.

Their vegetarian dim sum menu is genuinely thoughtful, not just the usual spring rolls and tofu. The standout for me was the vegetable cheung fun—silky rice noodle rolls filled with perfectly seasoned mushrooms and greens, drizzled with a sweet soy sauce that tied everything together beautifully. The vegetarian siu mai and spinach dumplings were also excellent: delicate, flavorful, and clearly made with care.

What I appreciated most was that nothing felt like a compromise. Every dish was well-balanced and satisfying, with textures and flavors that made each bite interesting. Even the dipping sauces were spot on, complementing the dishes rather than overpowering them.

The setting is classic and bustling, which adds to the charm, and the staff were friendly and helpful when I asked about which dim sum were vegan vs vegetarian.

If you're vegetarian and love dim sum—or have felt left out at traditional dim sum spots—Chung Ying is absolutely worth a visit. For some reason, we haven't been here for a couple of years (probably because there are just so many great places to eat at in Birmingham these days).
So, it was lovely to head back to Ching Ying Garden and attempt to eat our bodyweight in Dim Sum.

I love that you order what you want on a sheet of paper, then sit back and wait for the dishes to arrive in whatever order the kitchen make them.

The Dim Sum was the star of the show, loads of little dumplings still sat in their steaming baskets, alongside the steamed buns. Delicious.

I was a bit disappointed in the triple Roast Meats, however, I've definitely had both better and bigger portions in Chinatown. But still perfectly serviceable.

Overall, a very enjoyable meal out, we'll try not to leave it another two years before we go back! Exactly what I hoped for craving some good Chinese food. Lots of vegan & gluten free options.

Even with 5 tables there was no buzzing chit chat it just felt so cold and hostile, which is such a shame for a place with good food in a stunning location.

She also informed me of how to use the app and helped me get a little taken off the bill.

The loaded fries were lovely, and the mango lemonade was super refreshing. As for the burger – it was just okay. The signature spicy sauce had heat, but lacked depth of flavour, and the patty was a bit dry, which was disappointing considering it was Angus beef. I’ve had a regular burger from another branch before and it was much better, so this place can be a bit hit or miss. The cashier was very polite and patient. The service was great.
All three types of fries were delicious.
The classic beef burgers and chicken wings are delicious. I will come again . Burger & Sauce near uni is solid! The smash burger was juicy and full of flavour, but the real winner for me was the lemon pepper wings — crispy, seasoned perfectly, and proper addictive. Quick service, good vibe, and definitely worth the price. One of the best spots around for a quick, quality bite. I had the chicken and cheese fries along with the Angus Stack burger, and both were to die for. The fries were loaded just right – cheesy, flavorful, and totally addictive. The burger was juicy, stacked perfectly, and full of bold flavor. Honestly, it’s one of the best burgers I’ve had in a long time.

Service was top quality too – friendly, quick, and attentive. The whole experience from start to finish was spot on. Highly recommend if you’re craving proper comfort food done right.

I'm more of an eggs royale/florentine man these days but I'm so glad I went off-piste and ordered the full English. Quite incredible from delivery, appearance and consumption. I've never enjoyed a breakfast as much as this. Exceptional. A ""Michelin starred"" delight. Booked for Sunday lunch last week to celebrate our University of Birmingham student son’s birthday. We were a group of 3; my husband, son & I.
The whole experience was fabulous. The space is stylish, tables are a good distance apart & there are acoustic pads on the ceiling ensuring a non-echoey restaurant so we could hear each other very easily & the music was set at a low comfortable level too. We had cocktails to start followed by the excellent £40 lunch menu - all served at the right pace with very attentive waitresses & waiters. The food was beautifully presented, seasoned well & hot. Between the main course & dessert, we were asked whether we had a reason for coming & I said it was our son’s birthday & they very generously piped a happy birthday on the plate they served his crème brûlée on … which I thought was wonderful - the waitress had listened, responded & bought this unexpected accolade to him. He was delighted as were we. Overall one of the best meals we have had in a long time & great value too. 10/10. Would we go again! Yes - definitely. Highly recommended! We visited on 16.02.25 around 13:00pm. I had the lamb shank roast (with an extra Yorkie!) and my wife had the beef roast. Both meats were cooked to perfection. The lamb fell off the bone and the beef was still slightly pink in the middle. The raspberry sorbet was great and the mousse lived up to expectations. The only criticism is that the roast potatoes lacked any crispiness but the veg was superbly cooked. Service was great but to be expected when paying over £25 each. Can't say it exceeded our expectations but it didn't disappoint, either. Would definitely visit again next time we're in Birmingham. First time attending Chapter for birthday celebrations after hearing good things and it did not disappoint!

Upon arrival, we were greeted and decided to have a drink at the bar. From there, you can sample the great selection of drinks and see the open kitchen with chefs preparing the food to a high standard. It was also a good opportunity to get a view of the dishes available, which all looked amazing and helped us decide on what to go for.

After finishing our drinks, we were seated and ordered our starters. The pork belly starter was absolutely amazing and melted in your mouth. The flavour and quality was outstanding and I can still remember the great taste. Moving onto mains, I went for the lamb, which again did not disappoint. We all ordered different mains, so there was a wide range on the table, which was visually stunning.

I could not fault anything during my time here, the staff also went the extra mile and presented me with a birthday desert at the end which was very kind of them and added that final touch to my birthday dinner.

This is fine dining to high standard, and I would recommend to anyone looking for a special place for the right occasion. I look forward to returning here and would recommend it to all.

Thank you to all the staff members who were brilliant. Keep up the great work standards and food quality. I am looking forward to my next visit. I was shocked 😳
I had soup of the day,and it was tiny.Smallest as ever seen,I tried this dish in 32 countries and every where hot soup is serving with ciabatta or flatbread and butter and sometimes with croutons,in a mug or bowl (and a price is maximum 5-6£)but…it was smallish cup without nothing,and spoon I had after 5 min.,I asked staff about bread as usually (and it is in menu)but a guy said that I can buy it separately .This tiny cup cost 7£.I finished my studying and hungry wanted to find hot food.Not many people can afford this prices,in cafe where you want to find a food - so small portions,my friends not once told me that about Chapter but I wanted to try.I go out hungry and angry.I saw how guy served another people with tiny deserts and starters.
Please change this cup for bowl and put for this 7£ piece of ciabatta,because it is a serving for soup.All lounges serve big bowl of soup with ciabatta and butter for 5£,and it is tasty and healthy.

I had an incredible dining experience at Three Church Road Restaurant. The food was absolutely amazing—each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavour. The quality of the ingredients and attention to detail truly stood out, making every bite a delight.

The service was exceptional, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere from start to finish. A special mention to Vinny, who was brilliant—attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making our meal even more enjoyable. His recommendations were spot on, and his professionalism added to the overall experience.

The only minor downside is that parking at the location can be a bit tricky. However, there’s plenty of parking nearby, so it’s not a major issue.

Overall, Three Church Road is a fantastic place for a meal, whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just enjoying a great night out. Highly recommended! It's been a long time since I did my last review, but I had to break the pattern because the experience in this restaurant was quite amazing - specially because of the outstanding service provided by Sónia(?). She was very thoughtful and caring the whole time, and it instantly made us feel at home. The food is also quite nice and the restaurant is located in a very charming neighbourhood; couldn't recommend more. If there's anything bad to say, I would say that the person at the reception could be more welcoming, but I guess the rest of the crew compensated her lack of sympathy. This place is absolutely amazing. Five of us went to celebrate my 50th birthday. The food was exquisite of a very high quality. Our  servers were attentive. Our every need was met. We were not rushed, and my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon and we will definitely be back. Beautiful venue, set within a retirement village (so a bit confusing when a taxi pulls up to the doors). The Three Church Road restaurant is a bit hard to access - there are main doors with a sign saying the entrance is to the left, and you walk through what I think is the reception to the retirement home? It’s not very clear but we were able to find it without too much hassle.

The restaurant/bar is very beautifully designed, with lots of different rooms and areas to keep it feeling intimate and private, rather than everyone packed in one big room. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and made it a lovely occasion.

We’d come for the afternoon tea, which seems to be good value at £19.95 but was rather disappointing - largely due to the pretty boring sandwich flavours (tuna, ham & mustard, cheddar & chutney, and chicken tandoori) and the fillings were absolutely tiny - I don’t think I tasted any tuna. The staff were great in tailoring the food to dietary requirements, for vegans, gluten free, and generally fussy people who just wanted an entire plate of ham sandwiches! It was just sad they’d not opted for things such as smoked salmon and cream cheese, egg and cress, and cucumber sandwiches.

And the finger sandwiches came heaped in butter - a white margarine spreadable type thing. Sad. There were scones with individual pots of cream and jam, and a range of cakes though I found these to be quite dry.

Particularly with the sandwiches there felt like a lot of cost-cutting had been going on, and you could barely taste any of the fillings. You can pay £5 extra to enjoy Champagne with your afternoon tea, or gin & tonics.

Despite my disappointment with the food, it looked beautiful and was a lovely thing to do with friends, and we were very well looked after by the staff. Beautiful little restaurant hidden away inside a hotel with intriguing secrets like an ""owners' library"" you can't enter 🤣 The food is exquisite and the price is perfect. £75 for three courses and drinks for two people.

My kids love coming here too, because of that. The food and drinks are always prepared with care and any problems...it's solved!

This Costa has recently been refurbished and so, it's even better! shocking service , workers messing around , joking with friends ignoring customers having to wait long leaving a huge queue for customers. drinks served 10minutes later and toast was cold. Gave me my drink half empty , had to ask her to fill it. as you can see in the picture my drink was flooding and didn’t even add toppings as labelled in menu. Didn’t mix my drink properly My favourite Costa Coffee in Birmingham. Staff always lovely and kind. Nice open space place. It can get really crowded during the weekend but it's everywhere you go.
Since they have done the refurbishment it feels more uncomfortable. Ignore the times largely given by Google they are the Next closing times and Costa has to close 30 minutes before the store.

Sadly I fear they are going to ruin this one as well as it is due a ""makeover"" in March.

Charming nice looking pub in the Jewellery Quarter. Fantastic aesthetic. Enjoyed a lovely pint in here recently, but it was a historic one for me personally, as it was the first time I broke the £7 price barrier for one, something I hadn't even managed in Airports or Central London before.

Having spoken about this to a lot of other people since, I now realise this was an incredibly high price even for that particular beer. Have previously had a few good times in here, going back a few years. A nice pub on the centre of the Jewllery Quarter with the classic pub style decoration inside.

Friendly staff and a clean ambient. The food is great and the price is ok for the size of the plate.
There are burgers and sandwichs available and other smaller dishes like chips and salads.
I miss the old Fish and Chips on the menu tough.

The drink selection is great with things for all tastes.

Had a chocolate chip cookie which was average.

Also ordered a Nutella cookie dough with ice cream. Nice but think the presentation could be better.

No organisation with people waiting for their order.

Overall, my rating is average. Hate that they don’t warm up normal cookies, so disappointing but they taste okay. I got pistachio and milk chocolate love this place amazing customer service especially from Bismah, she was so sweet and quick with our food will definitely be coming back DELICIOUS! Best desserts place ever!!!

Everything is delicious there. I tried the Oreo stack, Kinder Bueno stack, Lotus stack, S****y brownie stack, Oreo milkshake, and Lotus milkshake and they ALL taste like heaven. Really disappointed. Paid ~£7 for some overly sweet cookie dough with cream cheese and biscoff spread slathered over it. Sounds better than it tasted.

The kitchen area looked really dirty, with a cardboard box full of squares of frozen cookie dough sitting open on the counter. All the staff had dirty aprons and I had to wait 10mins for them to heat one of these chunks of dough.

The portion was way too big for me and I felt like I was going to throw up after eating half of it (might be partially my fault for attempting to eat it myself).

Really wanted to like this place, cookie dough is usually really tasty but this was far from the real thing.

I purchased a pre-packed sandwich and found visible mould growing on the bacon — white, fuzzy patches that are clearly a sign of spoilage. This is absolutely unacceptable and raises serious concerns about food safety and storage practices.

It’s shocking that something in this condition was allowed to be sold. I expect far better standards from any establishment handling fresh food. This needs to be addressed immediately to avoid putting customers at risk. I stumbled upon this coffee shop while exploring the area, and I’m so glad I did.

Great quality and massive portions with an extensive menu (with pictures on the menu which is fab). This place is the best for sharing dishes as they provide small side plates. Note that this place is cash only but there is a cash point opposite the gay village under 1 minute walk down the road (can't miss it). Adjacent to the Dragon Inn wetherspoons, which is a great little combo in China town near the Hippodrome. Service is good and usually quick. Great for any meat and prawns, noodles or rice dishes - for a classic british chinese experience as well as some more authentic traditional options like skewers and hot pots/ tentacles, etc. Food was really nice. I’d give the chicken Choi Mein a 7/10- it did come a bit cold and the chicken was a bit too salty for me but I really did enjoy it. The pork mini dumpling buns were 10/10. The broth inside was so nice I had seconds so soft and hot. The sizzling beef my friend had and it was a solid 9/10, it was hot and fresh and tasty. The lady behind the bar was so lovely we tipped her and the gentlemen who served us were also really nice. They kept refilling the vinegar soy sauce and chilli oil that was on the table. Overall a solid 8.5/10 experience! I’ve been a fairly regular customer there, and today, as always, I was very happy with the service provided by May.

However, at the end, I was charged £11 for a sweet and sour soup, even though the menu listed it at £4.50. It’s not a big deal to me, but nobody likes to be cheated. Because of this, I’m not sure if I’ll return while the same man is still working there. Lovely little place, great food and reasonably priced. Great menu, lots to choose from. The only thing is no matter whether they are busy or not there is inconsistent service, depending on who serves you, whether they are polite or abrupt and well mannered or not.
Service can be really slow and take ages to be served or food comes out before drinks. Nevertheless, we enjoy the food we keep coming back. Cash only. Great restaurant! I dined in, so I haven't tried the takeaway, but the Korean style squid tentacles were amazing, and one of the best meals I had that year.

The service was also excellent! The staff was friendly, efficient, and made sure my order was prepared with care. The atmosphere of the place was cozy and inviting, making it a great spot to enjoy a high-quality drink. I will definitely be coming back for more! Highly recommended! I've come here recently to grab a couple of drinks and snacks for lunch, and absolutely loved it.

Conveniently located in our Bullring shopping center, it's the perfect lunch grab for me or anyone working in the city center.

We've had their Pistachio latte which was amazing and I'll be back for more soon. Another beautiful creation we got to try was their Lavender Matcha. Yum!

For food I'd recommend one of their croissants, I went for Chicken Tikka

So good! Tried fruit and ice foe the first time and their matcha was definitely good. It doesn't taste of 'grass' as other places we have tried and it had a good flavour to it. If you love croissants then they do sweet and savoury! I tried the pistachio and chicken tikka and both tasted good The staff are so arrogant and look like they've never smiled a day in their life. You'd think they were held against their will and take it out on customers. Drinks are good but sometimes they forget to add syrups and flavours.

I would have liked somewhere to charge my phone. Was good and secure. Not cheap but not silly price either and I paid in advance to make life simpler (but more expensive because I paid for more time than required). The entrance was slightly confusing and I ended up going to the station drop off first, but I wasn't charged for my mistake and where you come out is an easy return by turning left and then left again at the lights then arrive back at the carpark entrance. Lift from the carpark took us in to new street station or grand central or whatever they call it now - the massive shopping centre that used to be a train station. I parked here one evening paid at the machine, but now I have a fine of £100 or £60 if I pay within the first 14 days. I definitely paid. I was a female on my own in the evening and felt very vulnerable whilst stood in the car park alone at night at the pay machine. I have proved I paid with my credit card statement. They claimed I must have typed in the wrong reg plate when I paid. If that was the case, how did they know what time I arrived with the correct price to pay, if it was the wrong reg plate? It would not have been able to register the reg plate I typed in if it was wrong. After appealing, they said for MY error, I had to pay £20 admin fee for MY error. - good place for parking

As you can imagine, we took our custom elsewhere. I can imagine with sassy bellends of a host you’ll be shut soon.

Felt like one staff member who couldn’t be arsed to serve us! Went Ming moon in the end for much fun and karaoke - would really recommend other than here. This place’s team members would rather see it shut! Had issues with the volume in a room
Had been previously and was able adjust the volume, to however we'd like it
However during this experience that we had paid good money for
Entered room to find no volume nobs,
They had been removed and music was quiet, even our harmonious whispering was louder that the background music
Went to discuss this with the team
Was only met with a hostile manager that shared no consideration to this
We kindly asked if we could move rooms to maybe a room that was louder or had volume adjustment, only then to be told we’d have to pay extra for!
Already spent £30 on a room and then £30 plus on drinks for 3 people
Also extremely wild that 2 peach snaps and lemonade costs £21
The manager again showed no sign that he cared
Was bloody rude
When asked for name, refused but seem to think breaching GDPR rules was cute and gave us the name to another colleague (that wasn't even involved)
We eventually made it into a new room
The speakers were humming louder than we were speaking and the microphones struggled with connection …

There’s the option to eat outside; we were taken to a very beautiful indoor room.
The menu is very rich and varied, with dishes for vegetarians and vegans. The drinks are good.

The only downside was the staff, who were completely inattentive to the customers. They were certainly polite, but I had to struggle several times to get their attention. I had been to this coffee shop a while ago for lunch & liked it, but came again years later for breakfast now (it seems the menu spans both meals). The food is still lovely and our waiter Hamza was helpful - not too pushy when we needed longer with the menu, but still attentive enough to check up on us.

The courtyard feel with the tree in the middle adds to the thoughtful atmosphere. The only thing is that the music can be a little loud (especially for early morning!) Food presentation is very nice and a nice atmosphere. However, the food was too strongly spiced which made the chicken taste very bitter, Not authentic shawarma. Everything was extra salty. Very slow service. My favourite spot in the midlands, amazing food and spectacular coffee.
You can park opposite the restaurant there’s a large car park and it’s nominal priced.
The BEST Iced Spanish latte in the UK.
I’ve been here several times and the service can be up and down but the wait is always worth it.

The bar staff and Steward were very friendly,  helpful and happy to help. The piat match buffet was sausages, chips, curry sauce and two rounds of bread. What's not to like?
Oh, by the way, we won 4:1. 🏆 I honestly can't rate the rooms, we was there for the function room downstairs, this venue was amazing, Kstar Wrestling managed to get it very last minute after the previous venue let us down (with only a week's notice) friendly staff, very helpful and accommodating, would definitely recommend these guys the drink prices were good too!

The service & cleanliness were excellent.
The warmth & friendliness was so welcoming & relaxing.
The drinks were very good quality.
We were having a little stop off to have a drink & use the toilet.
We were really happy that we chose to go there. We totally recommend it!!! Disappointing flat white. Popped in for a coffee as it says coffee house on the front sign. Ordered a flat white at £3.30, a bit cheaper than most indy places and the menu looked reasonable and well priced but I just wanted some coffee. Ordered a flat white and served quickly but the cup was HOT, I then went to add some sweetener and when I took the lid off the milk was way too frothy for a flat white (or even for a cappuccino). I waited 5-10 mins for it to get to a drinkable temperature and it just tasted burnt. Both the espresso and the milk and the texture wasn't what I'd expect at all. Similar milk texture to a Greggs flat white but at least Greggs espresso isn't burnt.

I binned the entire coffee which I hate doing. I'll always try and force myself to drink something I've paid for but it was just bitter. Got a coffee at another nearby spot and there was a world of difference in the care for the process and the final drink.

It was very clean and chill in the cafe and I didn't try anything else so it's a middle of the road 3 stars from me. Unfortunately, quite average. The place is clean and nice looking. Their drink menu is nothing you can’t find elsewhere and it was just good, nothing more. Also the fact that they do Redbul ads doesn’t give much independent coffee vibes. It seems like a good place for people who wants to work or sit and read. I have never left a bad Google review.
This coffee shop charged 80p extra for oat milk - making the coffee £4.10 - which is rare outside of London.
It was a long wait for the coffee.
But, the reason for the bad review, the coffee was absolutely awful. Actually, undrinkable. It had a taste of bbq sauce. It went in the bin. The worst ""espresso"" I've ever had. It was just a half cup of Americano (not even an espresso cup …)

Sadly, it seems the staff might not know what espresso should be.",0.4,0.4,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

This was an afternoon gift and was a nightmare to make contact as the holiday staff when I phoned  had no idea where the Lobby was so no help there. The booking was confirmed hours before we were due to arrive and hey ho part of the Holiday Inn!!!
The most soulless place as guess we were accommodated at the last minute , even though booked weeks ahead.
To top it all we were denied a doggy bag (company policy) as no food allowed to be taken off the premises.
We  wrapped the left overs, departed and 3 homeless were very appreciative. Really disappointed. Looked for Lobby on the hill, excited to be taking wife for afternoon tea. Couldn't find the front door, so I went into holiday Inn next door to ask for directions, only to find I was there. Waitress then proceeded to seat us in the lobby, yes lobby, how ironic, and fetch the afternoon tea. Dumped it on the table, and we never saw her again, even though there were no other customers. Only people we witnessed were people checking in and out of the hotel. Really poor atmosphere, and to top it off, part of the food was scones and cream, but not clotted cream, just some sort of slop, like whipped cream for trifle, who even does that. No bits of salad with sandwiches, overall really disappointed. This is also classed as over 18s why I can not explain. With a bit of work, this could be a great quiet but cheeky cocktail spot.

We enjoyed the Breakfast, the vegan ash, and pancakes and blueberry. £39.77. On par with USA prices We were heading to a convention in the area and stopped here for breakfast.
We were a little early for opening but the lady was kind enough to let us sit and wait inside.
It was good that we went in when quiet as we got to explore the art on the walls which is very eclectic and makes for good viewing. There's plenty of space inside and out.
Parking is found on the side road or in the back but parking in the back is limited.
Food you could order through the QR code on the tables or at the counter and we did both as some of the party weren't comfortable with technology like that and they also wanted to adjust the order.
There was a little delay to my food but all due respect to our server, who came to advise that there was a small error in preparing it and it would take just a little longer. The update was really appreciated.
Food came and it was tasty! Drinks were nice too.
All in all a good place to visit but for a cafe I did find the prices a little expensive for what you get. But the service and food can't be knocked.

I came in earlier wondering which of the new flavoured iced lattes to try – ended up going with the Ube Brûlée one, and he very kindly gave me a discount as I was trying it for the first time.

We could've taken with us to the train, but we had so much time we just ate onsite.
Restaurant pleasant, nothing to really jabber about. It is clean and we could eat our food there.
The food was hot, so if you are heading for a long journey, I would recommend getting a takeaway from Wasabi and taking it to the train. Sometimes you do need something substantial and hot. That said, there were plenty of sushi choices available.
Definitely will be back. I bought a selection of food from here on Saturday to have on the train.  Firstly, they had no still water, then the carbonated water was warm, which wasn't very nice on such a hot day. I got my food and got on the train. I couldn't eat all of the food as it was very warm and the type of food they sell needs to be in a fridge. I had not ended my journey when I vomited the food back up. It was very embarrassing on the train. I was so disappointed and would not recommend it, or if you do go, check the fridges are working
I did not sit in, I had takeaway, so I can not say what eating on the site is like. This review is for the Birmingham New Street station
Extremely disappointing and costly Perfect for a quick bite before catching the train. It’s a bit hectic since it’s inside the station, but it’s fine — and the food’s pretty good too. I use this place whenever I visit Birmingham by my self or with my children.
There is always such amazing choice of sushi boxes and hot food.
Usually we grab a large sushi box to go and we have never had a bad experience.

Had an amazing meal at Barajee. The food was absolutely delicious—full of flavour, perfectly cooked, and beautifully presented. Every dish we tried was outstanding!

The staff were incredibly attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the evening. The service was fast and efficient without feeling rushed.

The atmosphere was great, and it’s clear they take pride in both their food and customer service. I’ll definitely be returning and highly recommend this place to anyone looking for top-quality Indian cuisine in Birmingham! This place gets 5 stars all round from me. It was my first time in Birmingham for a business trip, so I was eating alone. I came across Barajee and had to try my favourite chiken Balti dish. I wasn't disappointed. The garlic nan was also amazing. I asked for a garlic rice that wasn't on the menu and they were more then happy to make it for me. My waiter, Ray gave great service and I will defo be back the next time I visit Birmingham. In fact I will recommend this place to everyone I know. Disappointing Experience

We walked into Barajee as casual diners, and as soon as we mentioned we didn’t have a booking, the staff’s tone became noticeably cold and dismissive. No one asked about allergies or dietary preferences, and when we requested food recommendations, we were met with a blunt “no.”

Interestingly, once I started taking notes for this review, the tone of service shifted — suddenly more polite and attentive, which came off as performative.

Food:
•	Condiments were overly sweet.
•	Chicken Pakora lacked seasoning. The chicken was cooked fine, but the flavor was bland and the plating unimpressive.
•	Lamb Tikka was cold, chewy, and tasted microwaved. Not tender and poorly presented.
•	Chicken Madrasa was hot and the chicken was well-cooked — probably the best part of the meal.
•	Garlic Naan was sweet, not crunchy, and lacked butter.

At the end of the meal, we were given cheap-tasting chocolates and hot towels. The beer was standard.

When the server asked how the food was, I gave honest feedback. He responded by saying that the food is “only targeted to few people,” which was an unprofessional and unnecessary remark — and honestly left a bad taste.

Overall, the experience felt inconsistent, awkward, and disappointing.

Definitely highly recommend for anyone who likes Italian food. 🍝 Piccolino – Brindleyplace, Birmingham 🇮🇹
It’s the little things that stay with you – and Piccolino gets it just right.

At Highcliffe House, we’ve always believed in Memorable Moments — those small, thoughtful touches that turn good hospitality into something genuinely special. So, when I booked a table at Piccolino and casually mentioned it was my birthday, I wasn’t expecting much. But clearly, I’d picked a restaurant that speaks the same language.

On arrival, I was warmly greeted and, without fanfare, offered a complimentary glass of whatever I fancied (within reason, of course). I mean — how could I say no to a lovely glass of Chianti? Deep, rich, and velvety — the perfect way to kick off an Italian birthday treat.

To start, I went for their Focaccia al Rosmarino — freshly baked, delicately salted, and full of fragrant rosemary. Crisp on the outside, pillowy inside, it was the kind of bread that demands slow eating and good olive oil.

But the star of the evening?
Tonnarelli alla Carbonara — and yes, the real deal.
No cream in sight. Just silky ribbons of fresh pasta coated in a glossy sauce made from egg yolk, Pecorino Romano, crispy guanciale, and cracked black pepper. It was rich, indulgent, and perfectly balanced — every bite delivering that deep umami hit only a proper Carbonara can provide. The guanciale added just the right salty crunch, and the pasta had that beautiful bite you only get from handmade tonnarelli.

Service throughout was friendly, professional, and just the right level of attentive — the kind where you feel genuinely looked after, not hovered over.

In short?
Piccolino delivered that rare thing: an experience that felt both polished and personal.
A birthday dinner with soul.
It’s not just about the food (though the food was sublime) — it’s the gesture, the care, the intention. And that’s what lingers.

So grazie, Piccolino.
You served up more than a meal — you served up a memory. Nice Italian restaurant. Definitely on the fancy side and high class. I ordered fries, salad and a steak. Overall the food was nice. The atmosphere was nice and the place looks really good especially when you go in the evening. Would recommend for anyone who likes Italian and is ready to spend some money. Jesus Christ this place is absolutely shocking. Got seated straight away which wasn’t an issue however the service was absolutely shocking. I understand it might have been a little bit busy on bank holiday Monday but the staff are absolutely lazy and useless. I requested for the waiter to take my order and they said they would be back in a couple minutes. No one has came back in which I had to ask another waiter to take my order. This waiter also didn’t come back. The third time I ensured the waiter to take my order there and then. So we ordered 2 pasta dishes and 2 pizzas. Took about 45 mins to come out however as I was sat opposite the cooking station I must insist the food was let out on the hot plate for a good ten minutes as I could here the chef shouting at the other kitchen members to not leave the food out. Never the less they bought the food over to our take and our pasta was lukewarm and the pizza was just stale. Such a shame really as we have high expectations for a place like this. Will definitely be writing a complaint to the manager for the poor service. I’ve added a picture of the kitchen staff who couldn’t care less sat on there phone while I was waiting 45 mins for our food to arrive to our table",0.8,0.2,"[""Italian"", ""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Mediterranean"", ""Seafood"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Dietary Options"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Communication/Responsiveness"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

Nice options for coffee. Sitting available both inside and outside, with tables for 2 or more. There is a weird plantation inside, acting as a divider between the continuous sofa type sitting, but is a huge waste of space. Interior designing mistake?
The popular item here is ""White chocolate matcha"", you can get it in hot and cold (iced) versions. A kind of attraction of this place, as everyone can be seen a cup with green liquid. Worth it! Most of the drinks are available in small and large cup options.
It says skip the queue, order using App, we tried but the app wasn't working to take orders. Though you can scroll the menu in the app while in the queue, so installing it was not a total waste.

Atmosphere:
Rooftop restaurant, atmosphere is nice and good songs played throughout the dinner. View is pleasant but charged £5 per person for a window seat (came to an extra £10). There is a bar section that plays different songs but this does not interfere with the dining area, seems to be quite lively with people even dancing. There is a smoking area that provides an amazing view too.

Food:
Halal steaks are available if you require this but it is only the fillets. Do not order the calamari below, it is extremely chewy, the batter is stale, the sauce has a weird test (I would rate this 0/10). Steaks are nicely cooked and the peppercorn sauce is good too, mushrooms had a bitter taste, spinach is okay but not reasoned well. Ordered a side of chips and onion rings to share, onion rings are huge and I ordinarily like this style but they were extremely oily, to the point it becomes uncomfortable to eat. Chips were thick cut but also very oily, I would not recommend either of the sides. The only nice thing ordered was the steak.

Service:
Service was professional but we had to call someone over to order which usually does not happen as waiters come over. We also had to wait a while to pay once the bill was received. Other than that the waiters were very nice. Stunning views on the 25th floor of the building looking across Birmingham with large floor-to-ceiling windows. Beautiful on a sunny day. Worth it for the views. Food was tasty but sirloin seemed a bit overcooked for medium. Very good kind and quick service. Thank you! We eat on a set menu,
A great starter, a decent steak and a upgraded pudding.
The food is of decent quality for the price however the setting of the restaurant sets it apart and makes it worth the visit.
The staff were also very accommodating.
It’s worth saying better value for money can be found elsewhere. I have to say based on the service and the cleanliness of the restaurant I was a little let down. The food was sub-par and although the waitress was a wonderful sweet young woman she clearly was new and was thrown into the deep end without any real training, not her fault at all. The cutlery had to be exchanged because of a dirty set that was on the table and the glasses had spots on them. The staff and the atmosphere was the highlight of the outing and to be fair for around 50 pounds/person (Including wine) the steak deal was not terrible. However, my sirloin had quite a bit more fat than I would have liked. We went for a friend’s birthday and the tiny corner sliver of brownie (which was comped) was laughable. We decided to get another bottle of wine and enjoy the sunset on the terrace which did provide fantastic 360 views. Myself and my Nan visited this restaurant as a 80th birthday meal for my Nan. The food was amazing and service even better. We enjoyed every second of it. The staff and managers went out of there way to make this extra special, after my Nan having a bad fall in the Mailbox car park on the way to the restaurant. The car park floor was uneven and broken which caused my Nan to fall forward on to the concrete and have injuries to her hand and her face. She did not require the emergency services but there was no first aid kit available in the car park site, so I managed to get her into the restaurant and the staff were extremely helpful. They provided first aid to my Nan and kept checking in on her. We honestly could not thank them enough for their kindness and exceptional service. They even brought out a candle and brownie to my Nan singing Happy Birthday without being asked. Thank you so much, we will never forget how amazing you guys were.

People like her who turn a regular coffee run into a memorable experience. Thank you for your outstanding service — you truly made my day! ☕💚 ⸻

My favourite restaurant for Thai cuisine, every dish is packed full of flavour and the variety is superb for vegetarians too. An extentive drinks menu too. Our food was served super quick which was perfect as were famished! Jan was very pleasant and attentive. She even took some really nice photos for us, 10/10 for your customer service, Thank you for a fab experience. Ok, where do I start… I wouldn’t say this was a horrible meal, there were definitely some nice elements, but I also can’t say I’d ever return. The price and quality just don’t match.

We started with the seafood platter, which overall was decent. The sauces were the highlight and added a lot of flavour, but the shrimp was slightly overcooked and the scallops were a bit rubbery. Still, the sauces made up for it.

For the main, I went for the hot platter, which was quite underwhelming. There was barely any beef - mostly just a lot of vegetables. It was very spicy, which I don’t mind, but the overall flavour was just average. Honestly, your local Chinese takeaway could serve up more flavour. The rice was also just plain and nothing special.

The one thing that really stood out was the mocktail – it was excellent. Other than that, the meal didn’t leave a lasting impression, and I wouldn’t recommend it based on this experience.

For over £50 per person, you can definitely find a better place to dine. The food just didn’t taste authentic, local, or like the homemade-style Thai food you’d expect. When it comes to Thai cuisine, this place truly stands out. I’ve explored many Thai restaurants across Birmingham, but this one remains my absolute favourite. The dishes are packed with rich flavours and spices—from starters to mains and even desserts, there’s something to satisfy every palate. The staff are incredibly friendly, welcoming, and attentive, and the service is always prompt. While Birmingham boasts many great Thai spots, the branches in Harborne and Shirley are my top picks. That said, the service and staff are consistently excellent at all their locations. We celebrated my husband’s birthday with a delightful dinner at Sabai Sabai, accompanied by a few close friends, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience.

To start, we indulged in the full platter, a feast of fresh, perfectly cooked prawns, squid, and other delicious treats. For the main course, we had the rich and aromatic yellow chicken curry, paired beautifully with sticky rice and noodles. The chicken curry was simply outstanding, bursting with flavor😊.

The ambiance was warm and inviting, the service impeccable, and every detail added to the charm of the evening.  The team went above and beyond to make the evening special, even allowing us to bring in a cake and joining in to sing a heartfelt “Happy Birthday” for my husband. I will definitely recommend Sabai Sabai for anyone seeking an extraordinary dining experience. This evening, my husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Sabai Sabai, a charming Thai restaurant tucked away in a cozy corner of the city. From the moment we walked in, we were immediately enveloped by the warm, inviting atmosphere. The restaurant’s decor, with its subtle touches of Thai-inspired art and soft lighting, made for an intimate and peaceful setting—perfect for a quiet dinner.

The service was attentive and friendly, with our waiter taking the time to explain the various dishes on the menu and offer helpful recommendations. We also appreciated the variety of drink options, from refreshing iced teas to an interesting selection of Thai beers.

Sabai Sabai truly exceeded our expectations. The food was flavorful and authentic, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere made for a wonderful, relaxed evening. It’s the perfect place for a romantic dinner or a casual night out with friends.

As soon as I pulled up, she greeted me with a warm, cheerful ""Good afternoon, welcome to McDonald’s, may I take your order?"" – and I could genuinely tell she was happy to help.

Her polite and positive attitude made the entire experience truly wonderful. It's rare these days to come across such sincere customer service, and it really made my day. Kudos to her and to McDonald’s for having such a great team member! I recently had an unpleasant experience at the McDonald's drive-through. I ordered a Crispy McChicken meal, and upon taking a bite, I found a hair about 7 inches long in the burger with meat stuck to it. It was absolutely gut-wrenching to realize a slimy hair was in my mouth. 😢

I immediately called McDonald's and spoke to Christos, who kindly offered a replacement meal. While I appreciate the offer, it's really not enough to make up for the horrible experience. This has seriously affected my trust in the food's hygiene and quality.

Hoping McDonald's can take serious steps to prevent this from happening to other customers in the future. Safe food handling should always be a top priority. A month ago, ordered a McMuffin as usual. It came with adult size sausage, egg and one size of bread but with another bread in kid size. I requested to change it to get a normal size bread so that both sizes are matched. Finally it’s ridiculously that they gave me another kid size egg and bread to match with the original kid size bread. I’m explored and just made a refund. Never go back to this shop again We payed for ketchup yet we didn’t get any and in the fish fillet there was hair. The hygiene is insanely poor and can put someone off food for a while. Expected better. Love the mcplant! Always super fast and kind workers. Best chips ever 😋 would love some vegan dessert options or vegan milkshakes.

Fantastic service, the teas are refreshing and tasty (bear in mind I normally dislike tea) and the food is excellent. We had the vegetarian option and as my wife is allergic to beetroot they adapted the food to suit. The sandwiches were really delicious, and the scones were top notch too. The deserts were good, but not as good as the sandwiches and scones. Overall though, got to give this restaurant 5 stars. 3 guests attended for taster menus. 2 vegetarian and 1 normal.
Whole experience from start to finish was excellent.
Excellent first impressions being greeted on arrival. Great service throughout from very friendly staff who were very attentive without being obtrusive.The decor is beautiful.
Cocktails were excellent and the food just delicious, beautifully presented.
A very chilled, relaxing experience that wasn't rushed at all. The music adds to the overall ambience and was never too loud.
Excellent value for a taster menu.
The only negative I would say is l would love to return to experience the Al a carte menu but vegetarian options are very limited.
Can't comment about the hotel because didn't stay.
Highly recommended and I'm sure we will return. From the moment we stepped into Baloci Hotel in Birmingham, we knew we were in for something truly special. Themed rooms add a unique charm to this exquisite stay, and we had the pleasure of experiencing the Persian Room—a stunning blend of elegance and comfort.

The bed was nothing short of heavenly—sumptuously soft yet perfectly supportive, inviting us into restful nights wrapped in opulence. Every detail of the room’s presentation reflected an impeccable eye for beauty, from the intricate decor to the perfectly curated ambiance that transported us into a world of Persian luxury.

One of the highlights of our stay was the deep bathtub—an absolute haven for relaxation. Its generous size and indulgent depth made for the perfect escape after a day out, allowing us to sink into tranquility with ease.

Dining at Baloci was a remarkable experience in itself. We opted for the Michelin-starred taster menu, and every bite was an exquisite celebration of flavor. Each dish was beautifully crafted, bursting with creativity and precision, delivering an unforgettable culinary journey.

But above all, the service was extraordinary—indescribably top-class. Every interaction was marked by professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness, making us feel truly valued and at ease throughout our stay.

Baloci Hotel is more than just a place to stay—it is an experience that leaves you mesmerized and rejuvenated. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a luxurious and immersive escape.

Thank you staff, you are all so amazing! A Lovely Anniversary Dinner at Baloci

We recently celebrated our anniversary at Baloci, and the evening turned out to be a delightful experience. The ambience was calm and inviting, creating the perfect setting for a quiet celebration. The staff were friendly, courteous, and attentive, making us feel welcomed from the moment we walked in.

We started our meal with the Joojeh Koftah Kebab, which was presented well but could have been better in terms of flavor. However, the rest of the dishes truly impressed us. The Sultani Lamb Chops were succulent and well-seasoned, and the Kabuli Pulav stood out with its rich aroma and perfectly balanced flavors. Each dish was plated beautifully, adding to the overall dining experience.

To accompany our meal, we tried two drinks—Persian Sage and Persepolis—both of which were refreshing and paired well with the food.

What made the evening even more special was the thoughtful gesture from the staff. Knowing it was our anniversary, they greeted us with a personalized card and a plate of delicious baklava. The baklava was flaky, sweet, and just the right end to our meal.

Overall, Baloci provided us with a memorable evening of good food, warm hospitality, and thoughtful details. Solo restaurant visit a la carte.. Sunday 6 pm no one manning the entrance. The food was okay. Service was lacking and not attentive. Leave the water at the table. I will make sure my glass does not run dry.
The lamb filled croquette was nice shame you only got 1 in the dish. They gave me 3 upon request, which was nice of them. It helped me feel satisfied as I feel the portions are that of a 10 course menu.

I had a petit cigar from a range of 5 options. My host has little to no experience lighting one. about to light the wrong side.  He cut the thing dangerously low for my liking, but everyone should be taught how it should be an experience in and of itself.

I didn't stay so can not comment on the rooms or hotel itself just the dining experience.

It’s a platform that connects strangers together and you meet new people for the first time in a restaurant, interesting experience.

So Bill’s, in terms of the food I’ve definitely had way better food. The atmosphere is chilled and calm and the crowd is decent too.

I ordered the Sea Bass dish with Couscous, because I wanted a healthy option. If I ever visit there again, I’d try something else but I wasn’t the only one in the group that had something negative to say about the food tbh.

Decent food but like I said I’ve had way better food dining in Bull Ring. The Pomegranate drink was okay. Won’t be back, we were seated at the back of the restaurant, to be greeted with a sticky table and filthy glasses on the table…. Then we asked for a substitute for one of the items on a breakfast, as didn’t want mushrooms, to be told ‘No’!  Food was ok, my ginger beer didn’t have much flavour.  There’s a lot of choice for places to eat in Birmingham, this place needs to do better, in my view. Have been here a few times now and can safely say the food and service is always good.

Dropped in 19.04.25 and the guy who brought the food to the table just had the best disposition and was just so happy without being over bearing - kudos for putting a smile on my face.

Food is usually pretty decent and my go to is the buttermilk chicken pancakes which are usually top notch and my partner has the big brunch which is more than ample.

The only issue I’ve had here is that twice now I’ve seen a manager admonishing a staff member in the restaurant floor which I find to be totally unprofessional and unnecessary. Just makes for an uncomfortable and unpleasant dining experience if you witness this. Bottomless pancakes Friday.

I saw on instagram that they have a bottomless pancakes every Friday, all day, so we went to try.

You can choose only between two different kinds of pancakes, but absolutely deserve the chance to try them.

I had fruit pancakes, they were delicious.
And you can order more when your plate of empty for 90 minutes.

The staff was okay, really busy, so the time for wait the new round take time, (I only had two)

But I understand how busy they were, the restaurant is lovely and you can’t miss the location because is easy to find.

If you have a chance don’t think a lot and go and try them, next time I will go with my girls, so is a great date for have a family breakfast. Amazing place.

Delivery was promised for 30mins, it took 60. Everything was stone cold. I've never had crispy duck in pancakes pre assembled... The pancakes weren't fresh and ripped, tiny tiny amount of mushy duck in each. All getting soggy and lying in a thin watery sauce. Spring rolls were over cooked and broken, again everything in the spring rolls was cooked to some sort of mush. We didn't eat the meal after tasting. I can't believe other reviews are real/honest...

We’ve been a few times now and never had a bad experience. The food is absolutely exceptional, you really can’t fault it. On our most recent visit, I have to give special mention to the cheesecake, whoever tempered the white chocolate did an incredible job. It was delicate, crisp, and beautifully done.

Everyone was friendly and welcoming as always. While the service can sometimes be a little slow or unsure, it’s completely understandable as they’re still learning and you can see the effort they’re putting in.

If you’re in Birmingham, I would 100% recommend giving this place a try!! Arranged a works meal for 20 colleagues, needed regular communication in the lead up as people dropped out, it was no problem.  On arrival we had drinks by very polite bar staff before being shown to our seats.  Everything was laid out immaculately and the food was outstanding.  We had arrancini balls as a pre starter, which really set the expectations high, it was delicious!  Around the table, from the cod, beef, lamb, duck and vegetarian options everyone loved the quality, taste and portion size...even the veg and roasted baby new potatoes were delicious!  The desserts were also stunning in presentation, from mousse, trifle, baked Alaska, many of us were unable to finish as we were so full from previous courses!  The overall costs was under £40 for 3 courses plus drinks - outstanding value for money!  The staff were courteous and attentive and wish them all the best in their careers.  Can't wait to go back! 🤞🙏 Always a great night at the Restaurant with high-quality food, very attentive service from the students who are learning, and amazing value for money for AA Rosette food from the city’s future chefs. The 3-course meal also includes a free snack and a pre-dessert, making it 5 courses plus warm sourdough from their in-house bakery. Highly recommended. We have eaten here lots of times over the last 5 years , great food and a lovely atmosphere with the service staff learning their trade with plenty of enthusiasm, the chefs are well on there way to providing 1st class food at the best restaurants I  have eaten in.

One thing I would say is...... lose the TV screens, it's not a sports bar and they detract from what the experience should be, its a minor thing and shouldn't stop anyone going, there's no sound involved,  it just takes a bit away from a beautiful environment......for me. Found this by chance when walked near the Victoria Town Hall. I saw good review on Google map and never regret with my decision to give a try and the influence of the good reviews.

The lamb is super yummy, when I start eating I was doubting was I ordering a beef steak but it wasn’t, is lamb. I’m very impressed with the texture and the taste of the gravy. Excellent!

The appetisers and snacks are all yummy and served in style.

This is a place where you see the restaurant manager guiding the trainee students and they execute their role up to standard.

No wait to be seated at Saturday lunchtime which was fantastic. Customer service DOES NOT EXIST with Brindley Place Wagamamas.

We waited 25 minutes to be sat down and whilst waiting nobody spoke to us. We were a reserved table of 6 and the waitress ROSIE clearly didn’t care about her job, she was rude and senseless to us.

When we were FINALLY sat down we were placed at a table for 4!!!! Whilst there was an empty table for 6 with nobody sat at it. ROSIE then proceeded to place a couple and a table for four at said table for 6.

This really upset us as ROSIE didn’t even apologise to us and when we asked for another table she simply walked off.

When we spoke to LAUREN the manager we were then told that the couple that were sat AFTER us at said table for 6 were regulars and neither LAUREN or ROSIE apologised to us.

In fact ROSIE persisted to seat other people at 6 seater tables purely out of pettiness until we decided to move ourselves to one.

Nobody came and asked us how our food was and apart from AMRIT who seemed much more with it and helpful, we were treated with cold responses.

I personally don’t see how one cannot count to 6. However, be that as it may, the service that we were given was the worst customer service I have EVER received.

Just basic lack of common sense and people skills. It’s frustrating when we’d made every possible effort to have a nice and enjoyable evening and we’re treated rudely when I’d never treat someone with the same disrespect we were treated with. Came here for a lunchtime catchup with some friends from work. Bearing in mind it was Easter hols at 12pm, the venue was reasonably populated, but not full by any means. Despite there being quite a few staff milling about, there didn't seem to be anyone manning the front of house area (there is one here, otherwise we would have just sat down somewhere). We were seated after a brief delay. And then came the slightly longer delay of getting served. Which we did eventually - and from that point onwards - all was good. The menu piqued interest and the young lady serving us was attentive, friendly and helpful. Even showed us how to pay using the QR code on the table, which was a great idea. I opted for a chicken ramen with a side order of red chillies. My friends had a variety of battered shrimp and what I can only describe as ""dumplings"" and bao buns. The food was on point.

We highly recommend trying the pork belly and the tiramissu , both of which were standout items.

The wine selection is impressive, featuring a variety of options that perfectly complement the meals. Whether you’re a wine connoisseur or just enjoy a good glass with dinner, you’ll find something to love here.

The service was top-notch, with attentive and friendly staff who made us feel welcome and well-cared for throughout our meal. The atmosphere was equally excellent, with a open and vibrant ambiance that made for a great dining experience.

One of the best parts about Buonissimo is the value for money. Despite the high quality of the food and service, the prices are very reasonable, making it a great choice for both special occasions and casual dining.

Additionally, there’s plenty of local paid parking available, which makes it convenient for those driving to the restaurant.

Overall, Buonissimo is a gem that we highly recommend. Whether you’re looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion or just want a great meal, this restaurant won’t disappoint. We did book earlier sitting, it was not busy but I did feel a bit rushed, no sooner we finished first course the next was on the table,with out asking if we was ready, food was lovely and friendly staff I am not sure how to do this but here it is, my 3rd week at QE hospital, lots of investigations tests etc… a very special day today, International women’s day, I felt that I want something special to eat.
Checking Google maps for restaurants nearby I came across with this Italian restaurant Buonissimo. Pretty from the pictures, attractive menu just I wasn’t sure if they do take away so I called. Pretty little voice answered, that was Irma. I explained what I want and she only had to check with chef if food collection was ok.
Chef Mark comes on the phone and he finds out that I am in hospital and family will come to collect food etc. Next thing he starts recommending what he believes it’s suitable for me, about the food texture and storage everything that I needed but I didn’t know nothing about it.
Cut the story short, my family picked up the food and delivered to me with a lovely note from Irma and chef Mark, a wonderful bunch of flowers and of course a delightful Tiramisu from them ❤️.
I have no words to describe the feelings and the emotions I felt. The food I had was Pate D’anatra as starters and Rigatoni alla Buonissimo, sorry I have no pictures of the food but I have photos of the most touching gesture I have ever had in my life !!!
Thank you so much for the good wishes🙏🏼
Food was amazing, delightful taste, I believe the bread is baked in the house. Outstanding Customers service, very friendly team.
I made a promise to meat them in person once I am better and I will, until then whoever has a chance to pop in this restaurant please do so and meet this great chef Mark and gorgeous Irma with their team ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",1.0,0.0,"[""Italian"", ""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Mediterranean"", ""Dessert"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

I was only here for a drink so can't comment on the food. The interior has been done up nicely, and the beer selection is better than an average pub, I went for the Beavertown Neck Oil.

I don't know how to explain this, but the vibe seemed a little off, and slightly kind of uncomfortable and maybe unwelcoming? I'm not able to articulate properly in words what I mean, but it was enough to make me move on elsewhere after one drink. I have since looked through other reviews on here that seem to corroborate my view. A special shout-out to Sophie, Lucy, and Helen, who were nothing short of exceptional. Their warm, friendly service and genuine attentiveness made our visit really memorable.

What impressed us even more was how accommodating they were. We’d asked if we could watch the F1, and without hesitation, they made it happen for us — such a thoughtful touch that really went above and beyond. Was looking for a place for lunch on my first day in Birmingham. Stumbled into the Trocadero.  Staff was super friendly and prices were decent. They have happy hour from 5 to 8 M-F.  Ordered a cheese and bacon burger and it was a real patty.

Over the next few days I made it my routine stop of drinks. The staff here are fantastic and as a traveler made me feel very welcome. If you're lucky enough to get Lucy, Santino, or Paulina, you're in good hands.

Location is great too, in the heart of the city centre, close to New Street Station.  Definitely worth popping in for a pint if you're in Birmingham. I had such a fantastic experience at Trocadero — this place truly knows how to make you feel welcome! From the moment we walked in, the hospitality was outstanding.

It’s rare to find a spot that delivers on both atmosphere and quality like this. Highly recommend Trocadero — we’ll definitely be coming back!

Straight away worker (Aniket) said I cannot serve you.

Service needs to be improved. ordered click and collect. was so messy couldn’t even call it a sandwich. bread was thin and not like the usual subway baguette i get. when you open it
it literally fell entirely apart. i’ve ate here before and have had better experience. I am not sure why the staff at this specific store are always so impatient, I never go during lunch hour, I was the only one there and they act like there are hundred people waiting in line.

They never have the patience to place the food on the bread normally but always tossing them on there ( much less amount than other stores) yet have the time to pick the smallest slice of tomato ( as big as your thumb nail), I saw the female staff picked a normal sized tomato slice first then dropped it and picked the smallest one. It’s like the ingredients comes out of their wallet.

I could live with that until in my sandwich there I bit into sth really hard, and there were two, felt like small pieces of rocks, and that never ever happened to any Subway stores I ve been to. This is one of my two favourite Subway branches from all of the West Midlands and even London.
The restaurant is hidden away just off the University Guild so gets missed to the main eateries on site. What a pity. This a gem. And the staff are sofriendly its a great shame if you miss out.
I always chat away for a good 20 minutes whenever I visit as the staff are pretty laid back sa they are students or of that age group.
Very generous too on drinks and fillings.
Just look to the cycle shelter to the West side of the Guild to see the signage. The food was OK but service was rushed and there was only me and my friend in there.

I love the onions in it and the flavour on the chips. They even gave extra sweet and sour sauce which you can use on the chips. Overall, really great food and great service.

The restaurant is bright and cheerful with comfortable seating.

We enjoyed our food which was a pizza and cannelloni pasta. It came quickly and it was pleasantly served.

Good value of money. Nice place.
Stopped by when rolling around and sat outside.
Ordered a beer and food which hit the spot!
A visiting family from france seen i was a skater taking a break and their son was also on skates ( cool) and wanted to sit with the other skater so came on in and ordered.
Once done the father asked if i would skate with their son for a bit. Sure! so had a little roll round so they could take momento videos back with them. All in all a good pit stop. Location, food and a skate...Result Popped in before heading to the Utilita Arena, no reservation but got a seat right away.

Service was really friendly and the choices of food and drink were incredible, at a reasonable price (even more reasonable if download the app and join the Pizza Express Club!).

We shared a starter of Calamari which was delicious - breaded rather that battered. I had the king prawn laggara and my partner the standard king prawn pizza - both were delicious and we loved it! We were stuffed after so we shared some sorbet for dessert (a scoop of coconut and a scoop of watermelon). For drinks I had a garden gin and tonic, and my partner had a red wine. Both lovely.

Also kerala meals is a great vegetarian option, which has so many sides which makes it more worthy of the money we pay. I would definitely recommend this place. The person who servers and is in the counter is so sweet and amazing. Would visit again to try something else.

Edit: next i tried this parota and paneer butter masala, I regret my decisions. Paneer gravy was too sweet not good. Parota was average taste. Never buy that panner butter masala. The biryani was alright. However, the service was terrible. Ordered mutton biryani but received chicken. No pickles or poppadoms, and we waited forever for the raita. For three biriyani's, we split one small raita. We ordered lassi, but it's unclear whether he forgot or intentionally withheld it from us. Unable to even offer a glass of water. Average sitting space. I really wanted to try more, but after everything, I felt like I should leave that establishment right away. The food is really good here, a great menu with a wide selection of south Indian style dishes. The curries are rich and deep in flavour, the dosas are light and crisp and the devil dishes are not to be missed. Great value for some of my favourite curries in Birmingham. At amaa dosa, the extensive menu offers a plethora of options to choose from, making it a haven for dosa enthusiasts. The dosas, while priced reasonably, deliver on flavor, striking a balance between quality and cost. The restaurant boasts a pleasant atmosphere that enhances the dining experience. However, a notable drawback is the significantly slow service, which may test the patience of customers.

Despite the service lag, the overall taste falls somewhere between mediocre and exceptional, lacking brilliance but not disappointing. The culinary offerings are not exceptional, but they manage to meet expectations without being subpar. In summary, the dining experience at amaa dosa can be characterized as good, with the menu variety and reasonable dosa prices contributing positively. Improvement in service efficiency could elevate the overall experience, but the ambiance and satisfactory taste ensure a generally positive impression. 5-star for the food but overall service was poor and need some attention there. We have to wait for sometime just for someone to address and take our order but maybe cuz they start small and in future they will work on it. They bought the food a bit late but once we tasted, we forgot the delay and enjoyed every bit of it.

My order number was 1070, placed around 5:16 PM. Before I could even order, I waited at the counter for five minutes. When I politely inquired if orders were taken there, a staff member responded with shocking rudeness. She snapped, 'Do you not know how to use a kiosk?' making me feel incredibly foolish.

I explained that the last time I used a kiosk, it didn't accept cash. Instead of assisting, she barked several things at me, refused to take my order, when i stuck up for myself. and warned, 'Don't get me mad!' I was appalled by her aggressive tone, especially since I had done nothing wrong. It felt as though she was taking out her frustrations on me, which is completely unacceptable. I've worked in fast food myself and never treated a customer with such disrespect.

Her behavior made me feel violated. Had I not really wanted KFC, I would have walked out immediately. When I asked her colleague for her name the orignal staff member intervened again, shouting, 'Ask me, innit? I'm here!' in a threatening manner. When I asked her name, she said it was 'Rebecca,' but something tells me that wasn't her real name, as she was the only one without a name tag. In the whole kfc branch.

This employee's inappropriate, almost gangster-like behavior is unacceptable for someone in a customer service role. She needs to be held accountable for her actions and, frankly, should be terminated. No customer should be subjected to such treatment. I like this KFC. Friendly service. Delicious ice cream. Tasty chicken. Worth coming here. Food nice lovely and hot freshly fried a bit of a wait as always busy buts it's the best one in Birmingham sitting indoors upstairs and downstairs screen orders and counter service available. Toilets 🚻 inside a disabled one so a key needed a ramp and disabled access available Taste completely unique from any other fried chicken. For people looking for halal fried chicken this is the best option as all chicken here is halal.
Staff are very friendly and helpful, as a wheelchair user they bring my order to dedicated table. I'm a regular here and Everytime I feel similar taste with the mini fillet, fries and the pepper favour of fries are to die for ..

Usually have a meal here and it's nice and sometimes the wings are dry and unable to make us eat more than 5 at once but other than that it's usually good compared to other KFC

Seating is a bit odd as most of times the basement kinda seating is closed and around 8pm they start closing most of seating area leaving 3-4 sets of tables around and it's a bit of shame to see this and walk away when we got friends with us so plan carefully ..",0.8,0.2,"[""Burger"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Dietary Options"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

All of the food and drinks that we had were lovely (Although my salmon and avocado salad barely had any avocado in - definitely not as pictured!)
The only gripe, in terms of the atmosphere,  was that the music was so loud it was difficult to hear each other talk over it. 😬
Other than that,  we really enjoyed it (-although the chairs were very uncomfortable, and we all got quite stiff sitting in them).
Would definitely go back though, and would recommend.  👍🏻 I recently visited Zizzi at The Mailbox and unfortunately, the experience left me quite disappointed. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere seemed promising, with a cozy and inviting vibe. However, that initial warmth quickly faded when we were met with a lack of enthusiasm from the staff. The waitress seemed disinterested and almost seemed like she couldn't be bothered to take our order when we tried to use the QR code to order. It was frustrating because it felt like we had to put in so much effort just to get her attention.

We were hoping that the food would make up for the poor service, but that too was a letdown. We started with the calamari, which was incredibly plain. It lacked any real flavor or seasoning—just a basic, bland offering. It definitely needed more ""oomph"" to make it memorable.

As for the main course, the Slow Cooked Beef and Ragu was supposed to be rich and flavorful, but unfortunately, it missed the mark entirely. The beef didn’t have any of the deep, tender flavors you’d expect from a slow-cooked dish. In fact, I could barely taste the beef at all, which was a huge disappointment. The sauce was fine, but it couldn’t make up for the lack of flavor in the meat itself.

Additionally, the food took a long time to arrive, which only added to the frustration. It's hard to enjoy a meal when you're already feeling impatient due to the slow service. Overall, the experience didn't live up to the expectations set by the nice atmosphere when we first walked in. I really wanted to enjoy my meal, but between the inattentive service and underwhelming food, it was hard to walk away feeling satisfied.

It was my first time at a Zizzi restaurant but always heard that the food was good but it does not live up to an authentic taste of Italian food.

Staff needs to be more trained in terms of customer service. There was no point of the experience where they asked if everything was okay.

We asked to have the desserts served but it didnt come until another waitress attended to us. When the desserts came, they gave us the wrong dessert - instead of honeycomb cheesecake, they gave the lemon and blueberry cheesecake.

Another display of lack of training, especially due to the lack of staff.

Never coming back to this branch. Waste of time. Waste of money.

Glasses and cutlery were not polished.  Gross. On the 29th of March 2025, I took myself and my daughter to Zizzi as an alternative because my preferred choice of restaurant was fully booked until a later hour which was not going to work for me or my daughter.

I had a wonderful waitress named Indiana who was friendly, helpful, and polite. Initally the service was going great, where I had recieved my starters drinks and my daughter's main dish all in a fashionable amlunt of time.

However, I began to see time pass me as my main meal had not arrived. Indiana had approached me and asked if I had received my main meal and I had explained that I had not. At this point my daughter needed the toilet so I had to take her to the bathroom. Whilst on my way to the bathroom and unknowing to the manager and other staff, I had seen the chef plating up my food and placing underneath the hot light which was ready to be brought to my table.

I was in the bathroom between 5-7 minutes max and when I had come out I had Indiana along with another male staff member approach me apologising for my food taking so long to come to me and that they had spoken to the manager to try and knock the food off my bill. I mean god bless them.for trying they were absolutely lovely.

It was said to me that they knock food off the bill quite frequently when customers receive their food in a later time frame than when originally ordered and the 2 members of staff who had kindly argued for me and plead my case for me were unhappy with the managers decision as the manager refused to take the food off my bill.

The manager approached me with this fake type of happy energy and pretended to be apologetic about the situation and said I was in the bathroom when my food was brought out and that there was nothing she could do about it, even though i had waited over 35 minutes for my food which is hmjust absolutely unacceptable. Nevertheless, I just brushed it off as I didn't want to cause scene or fuss about in that particular setting as I did not like the managers energy, nor the way she had handled the situation as I found her to be unbothered and disingenuous about my long wait to recieve my food.

The manager asked me if there was anything she could do for me and when I asked if she could do something for me, she did not personally helped me as she walked off and did not re-attend my table, but instead made one of the other staff members attend my table which due to the poor service at this point I just wanted my bill to leave as my daughter was becoming restless, furthermore, I was unhappy with the insufficient service.

What should have been a nice meal for me and my daughter turned about to be mediocre and it would not be a place I would recommend or advise my friends or family or strangers to attend as the manager's complacency and unbothered mannerisms are off-putting to make you want to spend your money in such an establishment. We ordered a pizza with a sharing board- it was quite a lot in quantity for 2 people. Having heard a lot about this place, I was a bit disappointed with the place- the pizza base could have been a lot better, the starters on the sharing board were a bit too salty for my taste. Garlic bread was the highlight for us. Definitely on the higher end price wise. Would I come back here- probably for the location at mailbox Went alone and really enjoyed
Staff member grace was very polite and friendly firstly.
Food was great, had a sticky pig pizza.high quality ingredients and generous amounts. Looked as good as it tasted. Cocktail was served and presented nicely and swiftly. Will definitely recommend going by my time spent there

But it was an excellent stay. The rooms were amazing. I actually got a free upgrade! The room was spacious, they had all the right amenities, including free bottled water. The hotel is located right by the train station so it’s really easy to get to. The service was excellent from the front desk and the hospitality staff. The breakfast was great too, I liked that it has both a continental buffet and cooked options you can choose from. The choices are a bit limited but most people will find something they’ll like. If I come back to Birmingham, I’ll be staying again. Really beautiful hotel in the heart of Birmingham city centre.
We had a lovely, warm welcome. The room was an excellent size and very clean.
The continental breakfast selection was good, and the freshly cooked breakfast was divine.
We will definitely be staying here again. Amazing Stay at Malmaison Birmingham!

I recently stayed at Malmaison Birmingham for two nights and had a truly wonderful experience. From the moment I arrived, the staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and professional they really set the tone for a great stay.

The room was spotless, stylish, and very comfortable. Everything felt fresh and well-maintained, making it easy to relax. I was also impressed with the breakfast a fantastic spread with delicious options that really exceeded expectations.

The location couldn’t be better right in the heart of Birmingham, making it super convenient to get around and explore the city. Everything was easy to find and navigate.

The only small suggestion I’d make is that I would have appreciated being told about the spa services at check-in. I only found out about them through the in room leaflet, and it would’ve been great to know earlier to plan ahead.

Overall, an amazing stay and I’d happily return. Highly recommended! Rooms are clean and spacious but dark and decorated contemporary. No drawer storage but as 2 night stay no real issue as wardrobe has shelves. Safe in the room is digital and bathroom is well lit and spacious. I ate in the restaurant and my meal was served without fries  which came when I asked for them, but my meal was only warm by then. I asked for it to be replaced which it was after a heated exchange. The replacement meal was piping hot and a complimentary drink offered by means of apology which I declined as the meal was put right.
The restaurant management were polite and courteous at all times after the meal was replaced so I was happy. The service at breakfast depends on who you are. I have seen a bias on even taking orders based on the people that are at the table. Breakfast the first morning had to be returned as it had clearly been left under heat lamp for too long and made the eggs rubbery. However they did make something fresh. It may be a particular shift/members of staff but there is a definite lack of care and ambivalence to the guests at breakfast both days I was staying here.
The room was great, excellent sanctuary from whatever has dragged you to Birmingham. I am staying during a heatwave and the aircon in the room was a life saver. Spacious big bed and room, fridge, tea and coffee facilities. No bottled water in room, which is fine for me, but I know sometimes is nice to have.

I would probably stay here again but just know that service in the restaurant/breakfast is not something to expect much from",1.0,0.0,"[""Burger"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Mediterranean"", ""Breakfast""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

Staff consumed with their own conversations, shouting across tables to continue conversations? i went in for my birthday at around 12:00 on a thursday and it wasn’t very crowded thankfully, i had a lovely, LOVELY waitress. Emmer was honestly nothing short of delightful, very charismatic, very friendly and laid back, and truthfully she made the entire experience so much better. I ordered the crispy fried calamari, thai duck stir fry, and the passion fruit martini. the calamari was delicious and i really enjoyed the stir fry too, i couldn’t finish  the stir fry in the end but i had it packed to take home! as for the drink, a shot of prosecco was served on the side and though i’m new to alcohol it was actually really lovely if i had it with the cocktail :) i was checked in on here and there while eating to make sure i was happy with the food and service which i found really nice. will definitely be coming back for a dessert and coffee next time. i’m really enthusiastic on trying new things so this was my first time at giraffe, i do often get a little anxiety beforehand though but this really did not disappoint. the interior and lights were also a really nice touch.

also please give Emmer a raise or a promotion, she’s amazing and so so incredibly sweet. Visited here on the 13th February 2025 around 18:30, date and time is relevant as if the manager reads this they should recognise the members of staff on duty and the food and service was excellent!

For a railway station I didn’t really expect too much especially having had a previous poor experience at another location.

Very pleasantly surprised. Great visit! Several vegan options on the menu. Well presented food and tasted lovely. Able to use a plug socket at the table to work. Oat milk available. Music good and not too intrusive. Brilliant customer service from Andy S, who was helpful, friendly and really attentive - he's an asset to your business. Would definitely visit again. Service was good. Our server was really friendly. We were the only people there so was quick.

It’s a very nice place to spend your evening. Eat a slice of cake and a cup of tea with friends and family. greeted with a warm welcome. Bless her the main staff remember Chelsea was running around with all the sit in and takeaway orders. My waffle sticks took ages whilst others had nearly finished with their plates. later found the reason the machine broke down..as a result Chelsea made me a waffle with gelato on the house to compensate for the delay.(higher priced item!) Top customer service to prevent a bad first experience to the establishment. Chelsea is an asset to this place with her level of service, really hardworking. Highly recommended for anyone with a love for delicious desserts!! Grossly disappointing.

We ordered 2 items one worse than the other. They claim to serve the best karak chai ins selly oak, the less I say the better, watery and pathetic. Next item was the chocolate lava cake. Surprise surprise, there is no chocolate inside it and the crust is weirdly hard. Went to the guy on the counter he said that the chocolate is the lava, pls see the pics yourself. Lovely family-run business. The desserts were delicious, especially the Matilda cake! Everything was fresh. Customer service was brilliant. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Highly recommend this place. Devine Desserts in Selly Oak is an absolute gem! From the moment I walked in, the staff were so nice and lovely, making the experience even more enjoyable. I decided to try their karak chai, and it was absolutely delicious—perfectly spiced and comforting. Their waffles were incredibly fresh and soft, with just the right amount of crispiness, making them the perfect treat.

As a flat white lover, I was thrilled to find that theirs was spot on—smooth, rich, and satisfying. It’s amazing to have such a great spot nearby for when those cravings hit.

I had the Pineapple Express burger with the ODB fries, and my husband went for the Louisiana Slammer, added a beef patty to it (one of the specials) with buffalo fries. Let me just say, the food exceeded our expectations.

Everything came out hot, fresh, and full of flavour. The burgers were juicy and perfectly cooked, and the fries were next-level good. But overall, I have to give a special shoutout to the sauce on the Pineapple Express—it totally made my day. I ended up going back up and ordering a side of it just to have more!

The whole experience was fantastic and we had an excellent server who explained the Specials for us and made everything feel personalised. We’re already looking forward to going back. I consider myself as a regular at OPM but when I visited it at 11.06.2025 around 7pm, I think I won’t be anymore. I sat outside because the weather was quite lovely. Tables were a mess, all dirt and leftovers. Nobody came to take our orders nor clean the table for 15 minutes. When I walked inside, waitress in the bar took my order, said that I should pay in advance because I’m outside and didn’t even bother to come and clean up. Patty was really dry and chewy and their special crunchy wings were just sloppy. All around terrible. Friendly and welcoming staff, delicious burgers (and chicken), fries were good too.

Thoroughly recommend if you're in the mood for some unhealthy but delicious food. I’ve been here before several years ago and definitely remember it being better. That, or because so many independent & chain American smash burger places have opened, that I’m comparing to them. The market is now saturated for this type of food and unfortunately OPM does not cut it. The burgers are dense overcooked patties, and didn’t even seem to be decent quality beef. The menu was small, I think 3 or 4 beef burgers (for a place that’s got patty in the name), other than fries there were only 2 side options and one of them was coleslaw.
Mediocre food quality and taste, and a fairly long wait. Delicious food and a friendly joint. They were very friendly. I got the vegan special, spicy fries, and slaw. Everything was great. Probably the best slaw I've had in the UK (at least for someone that likes cilantro).
The vegan schnitzel burger was reaaaally good.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying another burger and maybe a cocktail or beer on tap!",0.8,0.2,"[""Burger"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

There's no queue system or staff is serving here and there and people who are waiting long, they're not noticeable. Nice atmosphere but too much notice.
Back after long time and there’s much progress in service. This a busy pub in a busy train station . I have to take my hat off to all the staff that even turn up for work .  More work needs to be done on clearing tables . We had most of our meal with someone else's dirty plates in front of us and the tables around us all had plates on them . The food came out quickly though, not the best spoons breakfast I have had but for the price you cant argue . No long trek to the loos too . We ordered through the app 3 meals with drinks.  Our meals came quickly even though it was utter mayhem with the amount of people.  Staff looked tired and fed up,  no smiles just blunt comments with serious faces. I understand that they must be worked off their feet and it was so hot, so i don't blame them for being low in energy. Especially if they are at the end of their shifts.
We were halfway through our meal and still had no drinks,  we were told there was 25 minute wait but we had already been waiting half hour.  It was a really hot evening and we were parched so I asked a passing lad who worked there about them,  he went and got them for us.  Shortly after necking our sodas, we needed another but the bar was 3 layers thick with people waiting.  It took us another 25 minutes to finally get served,  there was no order to the serving and we were walked by several times,  and other people who hadn't waited as long as us got served.
Then suddenly,  a bar fairy full of smiles,  bounding energy and gorgeous floaty sleeves fluttered into the bar,  zooming around making polite happy comments to customers and cleared up the back log in a mere 10 minutes. Whoever she was,  she was absolutely fantastic! Shortly after in the bathroom she was flitting around filling up the toilet rolls as every stall was empty in the ladies!
She was a breath of fresh air.
Anyway,  the food was rather good, just don't expect quick service at the bar.
Find this wetherspoons fairy and prime her,  give her a raise because she is a credit to that place. Warm and welcome from the station, lots of glass to watch as people go by, low prices compared to other places in the centre.  Lots of tables from small twin to Boothe and app ordering  which is quick and simple.  Menu is good, very reasonable, food was good and turned up fast. Absolutely brilliant venue popped in last night for a few drinks with a friend and wasn't left disappointed.
Great service from the manager Tash, who is a superstar and all the team were amazing.
A big thank you and will definitely be popping in again soon for a few more drinks was an incredible experience and night.

The venue has a great vibe — intimate enough to feel connected to the performance, yet big enough to handle a solid crowd without feeling cramped. The sound quality was impressive; every instrument came through clearly, and the vocals were spot on, which really brought the energy of the night to life.

The layout of the venue is smart, with decent views of the stage from most areas, and the tiered levels in the main room make it easier to see even if you’re not right at the front. The lighting setup added to the atmosphere, especially during high-energy tracks, and the acoustics made the whole experience even more immersive.

Staff and security were professional, friendly, and handled everything smoothly — from ticket checks to helping people find their way around. Entry was well organized and the bar staff were quick, even at peak times, which is always appreciated at a packed show.

Facilities were clean and well maintained, and the cloakroom was handy for storing jackets and bags. If I had to nitpick, the drinks were a little on the expensive side — not outrageous, but enough to notice. Still, that’s not unusual for live venues and didn’t take away from the night.

Overall, the O2 Academy Birmingham is a top-tier venue for live music. It’s got everything you need for a great night out and consistently delivers a quality concert experience. I’ll definitely be back for more gigs. Saw The Brogeals and The Latham's last night. All the staff members we came across were very helpful and friendly. Really appreciated the staff passing out water at the front of the stage as it got very hot. The security and ticket system on the way in was very smooth, just for visitors who don't have your ticket page open on the O2 App for ages as you'll need to refresh the page a few times before the tickets scan. As soon as the gig ended, staff checked on people sat down and were immediately tidying up. NPC car park is literally next door to the venue for anyone coming from far away.  Sound was great for the gig as was the lightning. Overall a perfect night and venue! I've seen many of artists here and it's always been amazing. Great venue with easy viewing even from standing. Staff are always friendly and procedures in place to keep everyone safe. O2 venues often get a bad rap. I like them. Been to this one many, many times. View is great from wherever. Sound can often be good. Staff are always pleasant. Sure we can complain about beer prices but 🤷🏻 Huge queue for access, but doors opened on time and took no time at all for the queue to be searched and in the venue.
Bar service was super quick for the amount of people attending.
Had a great night at a concert...
It took longer to leave the venue than to get in.
Could have done with maybe opening another couple of exits (if there are any) as it was like shuffling in a penguin group to get out.
Had it not been like that for the exit I would have given a fiver star review.",1.0,0.0,"[""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

CASH FREE RESTAURANT.
Half term is time to find the bestie places to go with kids.

This week we chose Pizza Hut because said that kids eat for free when you spend £10, BUT IS ONE KID FOR EVERY TRANSACTION, If you have a family with more that one child you only will get one child free at least that you do separate purchases for the food.
We do not make a booking before coming to the place, we has been there before and wasn’t so busy, but is half term so the best option is make in advance.

The Manager very friendly find the way to gives us a table, after one of the staff said that were very busy.

You have to scan QR code to make you order and pay online.

If you buy the promo for the buffet time is brilliant, you will have fresh pizzas, actually you can see when come out from the oven, the variety is very good and the salads island is okay, but I’m not a salad person.

And have refill with drinks and ice cream is absolutely amazing, specially if you want give a reward to your kids after hard work at school, plus have kids that finish SATs, deserve every penny that you spend.

Buy have no space for ramp or lift.

Was full of people but is okay, when you have kids you can manage be in a noise atmosphere.

The staff do as much as they can. Such a cute and cosy location. The Food was delicious and filling with the Me-Deal. I put 3 stars for the food and overall 4 stars. Only because I would prefer to have more vegan options. Otherwise it's a great family friendly option and a comfortable dining area too ❤️🍕 Kate was very helpful as you have to order and pay all on your phone. The staff friendly
The 3 star for the food was because the chips were not done well, but the vegan pizza was ok. The vegan cheese cake was yum too. Food came out quickly On February 22nd, I visited Pizza Hut with my niece, who had never been there before. We ordered a sharer deal, which included a Half & Half pizza with chicken and pepperoni, two sides, and two desserts for £40. Although it was a bit pricey, the food was very enjoyable. We also had the delicious cookie dough for dessert each 😁

The staff member we encountered wasn't very enthusiastic, but we didn't let that affect our mood since we were there for the food. We placed our order through the app, which seemed unnecessary, especially since other tables were paying in cash. But our waiter said was the only way took a while for us to get our drinks too

Overall food was brilliant and we saw other staff members been more than helpful so I was unlucky 🤣 We will be back Very good restaurant in Birmingham city centre and good value for money. The staff including Kate are so lovely and friendly.

I came in craving something sweet and was not disappointed. I had the kunafa milk cake, which was a perfect balance of rich, creamy texture and just the right amount of sweetness. It was soft, flavorful, and beautifully presented.

My friend ordered the kunafa pistachio milkshake, which was freshly made to order and full of nutty, creamy goodness. To make the experience even better, we were generously treated to a free scoop of ice cream of our choice, which was such a thoughtful and unexpected surprise.

The staff were warm and welcoming, the atmosphere was cozy, and every bite showed real care and quality. If you love desserts or are just looking for something indulgent and delicious, this place is absolutely worth a visit. Ordered a waffle from Ubereats.

It looked fine until- I started eating it and found a long strand of black hair in the waffle!!

I had to throw it away as it was very off putting.

Will not be ordering again. This dessert shop has been an exceptional experience so far. I first tried their Oreo shake, which was nothing short of heavenly—rich, creamy, and perfectly blended. Impressed, I reached out to the shop, where a courteous lady recommended another dessert. I ordered it through Uber, and it exceeded my expectations—soft, delightfully sweet, and incredibly flavorful. It had been a long time since I enjoyed such a delicious dessert in Birmingham, and this place has truly set a new standard for indulgence. After a long night, we just wanted to relax and enjoy some mocktails but this place was a huge disappointment. When we arrived, there was only one couch in the whole place—not what we expected at all.

The mocktails were over £10 each which is already overpriced, but when they arrived, they were warm and had bits floating in them—definitely not what you’d expect from a place serving drinks. We ordered the Berry Explosion and Blue Mist and honestly, neither tasted good. The flavour’s were off and the whole experience just felt like a waste of money.

Would not recommend—overpriced, bad drinks and not a great atmosphere. Terrible shop the service is outrageous there is no explanation to it! The women called me 45 minutes after placing an order on just eat to tell me the delivery driver has broken his phone so no delivery can be made and that she's sorry but  nothing can be done and iv lost my money. I argued it isn't my fault driver broke his phone I obviously want a refund she replied I'm sorry you can't its not our fault either its the driver your food is cooked so it has to be paid for I'm sorry.

The minimum Bets are low for Roulette (£2) which is good 😉  Blackjack is £10.  People say the staff are nice, some are, some I feel are just incompetent 👎.
Whilst playing Roulette, the Croupier swiped all the chips and didn't pay me out, I questioned this, he wasn't sure.  The small miserable female Pit Boss (with Glasses) sternly told me I was wrong (like she was even watching??) I challenged her asking her to review the CCTV, she kept refusing saying I was mistaken (I knew I wasn't).  Ultimately I asked the Manager to check the CCTV, and I WAS CORRECT👍
I don't think I'd go back there again, with incompetent Croupiers and crappy Pit Bosses, there's better places I can spend my money 👎 normally have a good experience , but the staff are severely unfriendly and moody all the time
today , i had 21 and dealer drew to 20 and quickly took my chips away and moved on to the next hand. i raised that i should’ve been payed out and i was met with aggression and hostility. they did check the cctv and found i was right, but instead of a profuse apology like any other establishment would give, all I received was a murmur of ‘pay the young man 30£’
aside from this , i do get offered drinks / food which is a nice gesture but then again i am praising staff for the bare minimum. Paul and Molly and Luke was absolutely amazing. I loved playing at the casino. Very nice people, offered me drinks and would recommend more people to come. It’s worth it!!! Staff are rude and/or miserable. I had a double vodka and Diet Coke and hubby had half a draft beer and it was £15! Just a standard vodka, not grey goose or anything premium!  The min bet on roulette was £5 or £25 for side bets. Min blackjack bet was £15 per go. This was a Thursday afternoon in January. So just priced us out really. We left after finishing our overpriced drink.

Special mention to the manager Sophie who was helpful with explaining what was what and recommending what to have based on what I said I liked!

Thank you! Not the best tonkotsu ramen I’ve had – it lacked the creaminess and depth of flavour you’d expect, but overall the quality was decent. It’s a good option if you’re passing by and want something quick, warm, and comforting. Especially nice on a cold day. Delicious food. It came so quickly and the staff were lovely. I think it's a brilliant idea that you can have small portions at a discounted rate! The food and service was amazing. I had the king prawn katsu curry and rice and the gyozas and also chicken ramen and I loved it. Connor, I believe his name was, was my server and he was very accommodating and friendly. He helped me in deciding what to eat and was very nice to speak to. 10/10 We had a fantastic experience at Tonkotsu in Selfridges, Birmingham.

If you're into rock/metal and looking for a place that delivers both great music and great vibes, this spot is a must. 🤘🍻 Came to watch the 'back to the begining' ozzy live stream, Absolutly awesome day/night, got pretty busy in there but atmosphere was electric, amazing and friendly and the bar staff are so quick and efficient at what they do we hardly had to wait for service, definitely be back. Great place to be. Good atmosphere and nice choice of drinks. We where there after the Black Sabbath / Ozzy Osbourne farewell gig. Had a lovely night out there. This place has been around for decades and been here a few times, especially as a stop before moving onto a club. Popular rock music venue. Relaxed, chilled and easy going.
They have live rock bands on weekends from time to time. Not a very big venue.
A couple of pool tables to the side at only £1 per game, making it popular. No thrills and fair prices at the bar.
We just popped into play pool and have a few drinks.
Good atmosphere Friday night.
Obviously music is not to everyone's taste, unless you like rock.
They have a small garden at the back for smokers. If you've left a club at say  2am and need somewhere to go as its too early to go home then it has to be Subside.

Horrible, horrible, horrible! This is by far the worst place I have ever stayed in my life. The staff were shockingly unfriendly—completely lacking basic manners or any sense of customer service.

My room was boiling hot, and when I asked the receptionist if I could move to a cooler room, she didn’t even bother to check the system. She just said, “All rooms are fully booked,” with an attitude like she owns the entire Travelodge. No apology, no effort, nothing.

I felt dismissed, disrespected, and completely let down. I’ve stayed in budget hotels before, but this was something else—zero professionalism, zero empathy. I honestly wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone.

This stay has left a bad memory I’ll never forget. Avoid this place at all costs! Great stay overall! The room was cool, clean, and in a peaceful part of Birmingham — a nice break from the busy city centre. The view was lovely too! The receptionist was super friendly and chatty, which made the check-in process quick and welcoming. I booked online and had my key within seconds, which was really convenient. Looking forward to trying the breakfast tomorrow. So far, a smooth and pleasant experience! Don’t stay here in warm temperatures. The rooms aren’t air conditioned and are ridiculously hot. Asked for an extra fan and told that they don’t have any. If they don’t have air conditioning, they should at least have large, powerful fans that can make a difference. Worst 2 nights sleep that I have ever had.

On a positive note, some of the staff are really friendly. The breakfast staff and the Australian guy on reception were all good. Great location to get to different events. Gave the Room 3 Stars as it was very noisy outside, even though the bed was very comfortable and the room & bathroom were both very clean. There seemed to be 'deliveries' (somewhere locally) resulting in either Lorries reversing & 'beeping' or people pushing large 'flatbeds' in the early hours. On our second night (at 4am) a car was parked outside with disco musuc blaring & people singing. One of the worst hotel experiences I’ve had

This hotel was a complete disappointment. Cleanliness was clearly not a priority. My room had a filthy carpet that seemed like it had never been cleaned. The furniture was extremely old and in bad shape, so much so that I didn’t even want to touch anything. The bedding looked decades old and worn out.

The bathroom wasn’t any better: a cheap, ugly shower curtain, low-quality toiletries, and an overall unclean feel. The entire hotel had an odd, unpleasant smell throughout.

Breakfast was disaster. Dirty cutlery, very old dishes, and extremely poor food quality. I stuck to only pre-packaged items out of concern. The coffee tasted awful, definitely the lowest quality possible.

As for the location, it might be close to the city center with train/bus stations being in walking distance, but the neighborhood is far from welcoming. I felt unsafe just walking outside the hotel. The area was dirty and made me uncomfortable.

I absolutely do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

Friendly staff. Very welcoming environment. So much fun... looking forward to going back. It is a great facility, with lots to climb, but....

I have come here for over 2 years and I have to agree with other reviews about the customer service, it has gone downhill during my membership here. I'm not sure whether this is a training issue or if the staff aren't motivated enough, but I'd like to feel more welcomed to a place that has helped with my mental health so much.

I have worked in retail and customer service roles for most of my career and good customer service can turn someones day around. Even though they are the only bouldering place in Birmingham, they are still very good. Facilities are clean and readily available, and prices are clear. Boulders are changed regularly enough to go for fun consistently and have new routes to try.

My only gripe is if you're a new climber, the customer service can be a bit misunderstanding of what you know and that can be rude. If you know what the shoes are and how to climb its chill (watch some videos). I mostly visiting during the day for a coffee and climb -  where I find the centre really welcoming. You can tell that the people that work there are really passionate about climbing, which is great if you want to talk anything and everything about the topic!

I had the chicken wrap, which was packed with flavour, juicy chicken, and a nice kick of spice. The chips were crispy and well-seasoned, and the pasta was creamy and comforting – perfect as a side dish.

To note, the menu says signature chips, but it's just regular chips, albeit they weren't greasy or thin french fries.

It was Chicken Ceasar Salad times 2. Unfortunately,  as it looks on website and actual food, no match and similarity. Very disappointed  and worst salad full of lettuce only. Sent email to restuarant few days ago, and called a staff to check and reply. No answer till date.   Not worth money and won't buy again.  Surely, anyone can see and tell looking at images. Expect restuarant to reply and look into it. Ordered a chicken and rice from here. The rice that they gave is ‘Uncle Ben’s’ rice.
Disgusting, wouldn’t dare come back here in my life.
The chicken with the rice is pretty decent, cooked correctly but the flavouring is not on point. Rather stick to the original ‘Pepes’.
Everything is ready made, food is done within 3/4 mins of ordering. Personally I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone!

By the end of my stay 4 days later. It still wasn't fixed.  No communication/updates from the staff. No compensation. No gestures of good will. I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful throughout. The room was spotless, spacious, and offered stunning views – a real highlight. It was also peaceful and quiet, perfect for a good night's rest. The location is excellent, just a short walk to the city center. Highly recommend! Hideous! No air con during June heatwave. Room temperature was 29 degrees.  Was offered a fan. No sleep. Unacceptable for a modern middle ranking hotel in a city centre.  Inhumane conditions.  Other guests all making same complaint.  Should be offered refunds as a minimum! The hotel AC just pumped out warm air all night, unbearably hot and got no sleep at all! I had colleagues staying throughout the hotel on different floors all with the same issue, no one got any sleep, shocking from a Radisson hotel.

Large crack in the living room cupboard mirror, wardrobe door didnt really shut properly without force and it has an automatic light inside. Large chip in the bathroom sink and dark mark on the grout in the shower. Also the bedroom aircon was incredibly weak. When room was turned down on my last full day. Water bottles weren't replaced which was annoying. I would stay there again, but not sure id waste my time on a suite.

From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome. Their service was attentive, friendly, and professional, creating a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere throughout our visit. The venue itself is vibrant and stylish, with a warm, eclectic décor that gives it a lot of character. It’s the kind of place where you instantly feel comfortable, whether you're there for a casual bite or a longer evening out.

We opted for a selection of tapas, and every dish we tried was absolutely delicious. The menu offered a great variety, and everything was beautifully presented and full of flavour. The portions were generous too, which made sharing really enjoyable. It’s clear that care is taken not only with the food but also with the overall experience.

The lively yet laid-back vibe made it the perfect spot to unwind with friends. It’s rare to find a place that gets the balance of great food, top-notch service, and inviting ambiance just right, but Arco Lounge nails it.

We’ll definitely be returning soon—and recommending it to anyone looking for a great evening out. A real gem of a place! My friends and I have been coming to the Arco lounge in Harbourne for a number of years and it never disappoints!
Serene atmosphere with the gentle lighting and music and the fab decor ( such a wide variety of paintings ) that compliment the warm and welcoming manner of staff especially the gentleman manager who served us today.
Thank you so much ( apologies for not asking your name) but your hot chocolates were delicious!!
You made us smile so much today and it’s was so lovely to feel appreciated for being returning customers who are remembered and appreciated-thank you, thank you!
And the food always fresh ,
tasty , great portions and value for money and as a vegan some firm favourites: simple sausage butty which the chef always makes bespoke for me ( bless) with side of grilled red onions , sliced avocado and mayo, the smashed avocado brunch or the bang bang cauliflower and least but not least favourite- the vegan chocolate & Raspberry Torte! Chocolate heaven ! Absolutely amazing service when we visited tonight and the food was incredible - quite possibly the best vegan burger I’ve had.

With a few complex allergies we often find it difficult to eat out, but the staff here went above and beyond. Really grateful, thank you for a lovely meal! We had to travel a good distance to get here as we were looking for a place to enjoy coffee and good conversation. Difficult on a Sunday night in Birmingham. We were not disappointed as the coffee was great and the atmosphere welcoming, if I lived in this area then it would be my go to place. Next time I’ll try the food menu. If a perfect cozy place for dinner exists ! Your search is over. This is your one spot place for yummy Multi cuisine food.

My favourite is the mixed donner and fries, the guys do an amazing combination with some extra spices added on, making this unique and addictive meal one of my favourites. The foods are good with very competitive prices, I prefer this restaurant than similar fast-food ones nearby. The service speed is okay, but the staff is a bit cold. There will be a 50p extra charge if paid by cards. Staff member serving was extremely rude and dismissive from the get go. Ordered a meal from the menu with a price clearly stated. Asked to pay with card and he didn't say the price, asked to see the card reader and after reluctantly showing me it was 50p more than stated. When challenging this he said its 50p for card payments, reminded him this is illegal and he refused to let me pay the correct price. Abandoned my order in the end on principle. After seeing other reviews its clear they are relying on people being too drunk not to challenge the extra charges they add on. Shocking experience with the shop. Was standing around for a minute before I was served.

The food is delicious as always but they didn't really give us the typical 'extra' fries like they do other places. The seating was very inadequate, no one was cleaning the tables so there was piled up trash on each empty table from various guests. Otherwise, the burgers themselves were fantastic! It's a standard 5 Guys so no particular surprises with the food, service or restaurant ambiance.

Burgers are good but not exceptional.  Fries as always are a little over salted. Peanut butter shake was great. Fantastic burgers! It is expensive for a fast food place but it was totally worth it. The burger seemed small but they put so much stuff in it, and their patties are so big you realise how big of a burger is. I didn't really like the chips, I prefer the chips more crispy, but leaving the skin add a nice taste to it. Definetly suggest you to try it. Nevermind how unhealthy the food is. Nearly had a heart attack looking at the prices. For three of us to have a burger each, share 2 large fries and 2 regular soft drinks came to over £40. However the food was very nice. But I wouldn't say it's anything special. There was also a lot of salt on the fries. I would return but not somewhere is go often and that's only due to the price of the food. Probably the best burger I have ever had in my life. The food was served in decent time (it was fun to see it made fresh in front of you).

Very polite,kind and funny an absolute treasure. Made sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. Travelled a long way with my daughter to attend a concert at the utilita and he gave us a map and advice on the best places to go and how to get there. He was super attentive even my teenage daughter said he was absolutely lovely and 'jokes'. The hotel interior is nice too so plenty of places for my teenager and her insta posts :) The rooms are very clean,spacious and smell good too and all the facilities in the room were easy to use. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely use this hotel anytime I visit Birmingham. Thank you so much for making our stay a memorable one 💗 Shockingly bad stay here. First was given a room that smelt so strongly of cigarettes and smoke it actually kept me up all night sick. Naturally I asked to move rooms. As I’m not a smoker and this was affecting my health. So I had to go all the way down to reception and I felt I was made like they were doing me a favour or something by giving me a different room. The new room was another shambles of an experience as it was a wheelchair access room and everything was so low down. It made using the bathroom extremely uncomfortable. Plus the fridge was filthy. At this point it was late at night I was on my own and didn’t have the energy to ask again for a DECENT room! I felt sick all night from the first room and its smell. I’m still waiting for my refund. And to top all this off I was charged £23 for breakfast with £5 being “delivery”. Never again. Despite a delay in our room being ready, Matthew looked after us and was incredibly polite and had a great sense of humour. We were given a drink voucher each while we waited which was incredibly kind. Our room was enough for the one night stay, had plenty of natural light, quiet a/c, comfortable beds and pillows, and a incredibly clean bathroom. Less than a minute walk to the nearest tram stop meant we could get to the city centre with ease and back safely from our concert that evening.

Thank you again Matthew for looking after us. Will definitely come back there next time we visit Birmingham. Lovely stay for 1 night.

Was quickly refried then placed on a bun. The taste was very good, but way too.much sauce. This was their signature burger, Real shame but our order was completely wrong.

The pizza arrived hot and fresh, with that signature soft, chewy crust and a generous layer of cheese. I went with the classic Pepperoni and added some extra mushrooms—flavors were solid and the toppings were nicely distributed.

The garlic dip is still one of the best parts of the meal—creamy, rich, and perfect for crust-dipping. The sides (cheesy garlic breadsticks and chicken poppers) were decent, though a little greasy.

Delivery was on time, packaging was secure, and everything was still warm when it arrived. Prices are a bit higher compared to some other chains, but the quality generally matches up.

Mr Abhinav is so kind and helpful What made the visit even better was the service. Abhinav was friendly, welcoming, and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. They offered great recommendations and made us feel like valued guests. It’s rare to find that kind of genuine hospitality these days. Great Service and Customer Care

I recently visited Papa John’s, and the service was excellent. From the start, the staff - Abhi made me feel welcome and took the time to make sure my order was just right. They didn’t rush me and even gave helpful suggestions.

While I waited, Abhi kept me updated, which made me feel valued as a customer. When my pizza was ready, it was hot, fresh, and exactly how I ordered it. Overall, Abhi specifically provided an easy and enjoyable experience, with great customer service. I’ll definitely be coming back! I have been to store a few times.
The pizza is delicious here, and the way abby receives the customer is very well. He explains about the toppings very well and suggests a  good one for the customers. Excellent food. Excellent staff.

Excellent place to park, the spaces are wide and the ramp to the parking areas are also wide. Easy payment using cash or card and the rates are good. Located in the Chinese quarter, so easy access to the hippodrome, bullring and brum city centre. The location is very convenient as it is near the Bullring , Grand Central restaurants within Hurst street. It is also just above the indoor market. There’s plenty of spaces and it has a lift which makes it accessible. However it is a little bit on the pricier side. Used this car park yesterday as a quick shop as it states on both their own and the councils websites that it has free designated parking for motorcycles on the first floor of the car park.

The first problem was that they have AMPR barriers at the entrance an exit so the system wouldn't recognise my bike as ot only has a rear registration plate. Had to phone an operator at the ticket machine and they let me through and said that parking would still be free.

I've finally entered and done 3 laps of the first floor and 1 lap of every pther available floor to try and find these designated parking spaces for motorcycles, and came up short as there are no spaces solely for them. There were designated disability spaces and electric charging points, but nothing for motorcycles.

I rang the operator again to ask where these spaces where and he just told me that I should just park somewhere sensible and I should be alright. I chose an empty space on the first floor trying to follow what they originally claimed on the website.

Upon my exit I had the same problem of the ANPR system not recognising my motorcycle and had to phone an operator again to be let out.

Don't get me wrong the car park is well maintained, has good sized spaces for cars and has CCTV everywhere in the facility, but they need to update their ANPR system and actually add some motorcycle parking bays because without those features parking on with a bike is more trouble than it's worth. Well lit clean carpark with plenty of parking, 3 lifts to get in and out, bays are a bit tight for big cars but manageable. I think it's an expensive car park though",1.0,0.0,"[""Bar/Pub"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Portion Size""]"

Gave it a try and can’t complain. Food was all fresh and hot, I got a loaded Sizzler box meal with a piece of chicken. The sizzler burger was the best bit in a really soft bun and the hot wings were nicely seasoned and had a crunchy batter. The only area they could improve would be their fries were soggy whereas I prefer crunchy fries. They have a huge menu to choose from!

Service was really fast and friendly from the guys behind the counter and the shop was clean and tidy. Honestly the best Dixy in Birmingham. The uber eats order had everything, every sauce and they added for free and the food was really fresh the quality of the chicken on point. Well done guys! Having ordered here regularly, I thought I'd write a review :)

Food is always fresh and hot, the quality is quite good considering the value. Portions are quite generous.

The wings are crispy and strip's too.

The burgers are great and fresh, full of flavour. Meat is crisp but tender.

Fries are crispy usually unsalted and not greasy.

Order notes are always followed and always plenty of sauces provided.

For quality locally available fried chicken I would definitely recommend Dixy Chicken in this location. Thanks I ordered from Dixy through Justeat and was pretty disappointed. The food wasn't up to mark – it wasn't hot, and the freshness was definitely lacking. The mini burger was a soggy mess because the bun just didn't seem fresh at all. Also, the corn on the cob had this weird, off taste that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it wasn't good. Overall, not a great experience this time around. I was very disappointed with the meal I received. The chicken wings seemed like it had been prepared the day before—it was extremely dry and completely lacking in flavor. This was not what I expected and certainly not up to acceptable standards.

People openly eating their own packed lunches. Had to ask someone to move their stuff off one of the four chairs they were ‘using’. Presumably the university subsidise it. Very poor customer service;
Staff mixing up coffees, my cortado is almost the size of latte. Staff refusing to serve in glass saying that an hour before closing they only serve in paper cups to drink in. Point scanner didn’t work for the third time in a raw. Just the job after a punishing exercise regime if you are not on student loan. Putting back the calories is perhaps not a good idea.  Once in a while for a treat is fine.  Prices are not suited to full-time students and the choices of food is limited for me as most are non-Halal. The staff are lovely in this Costa, but the coffee is always cold. They froth the milk first and by the time they pour it in the froth has already gone cold. For £3.25 I just don't think I'll go back. I did mention it, and apparently they use a temperature gauge but in my opinion they should heat the milk last, not leave it to stand for 3 mins while they complete the rest of the transactions. I haven't had this occur with other Costa outlets.

The staff is very friendly and it feels like you came over to their home.

Very quiet and peaceful atmosphere by the channel. The decor of the place is super cool and authentic.

The food came in a timely manner and it was of the right temperature and it tasted delicious. The only hiccup was that I washed for hollandase sauce to be on the side instead of the top of my eggs but they misunderstood and gave me an extra Hollandese sauce. Despite that I still enjoyed the food.

Would definitely come back! Had the most wonderful afternoon at Jujus, eating, drinking, laughing and looking after the dog! Can’t recommend this place enough and the Sunday Roast is AMAZING! Will be back soon to sample breakfast! This cafe is not pretending to be anything it's not!
It's cost and wholesome food!
We were in town for a show and came here for breakfast. The menu looked good and the food did not disappoint!
We had parked about 10 mins away and I didn't see any parking local to this cafe, so make plans before hand if you are traveling by car.
We were welcomed warmly and within moments seated. It looks small but has a surprising amount of space. Which it needs as it was very popular and filled up pretty quickly!
You order by scanning the QR code, which seems to becoming the norm these days.
When the food came it looked amazing and tasted just as good. It has a lot of options for vegetarians!
A point about the coffee! It was lovely! Usually I end up adding a little sugar to dull the bitter taste, but here it tasted amazing! Just right!
Highly recommend this place but I'm guessing when the weather is better, this place is that much more in demand.
Definitely one I saved to come back to when in the area again.
ENJOY! I have been to JuJu’s several times in the last year and have loved each visit.

It was all absolutely delicious. The ‘chips’ served with the roe were so good no other chip will ever be the same again. The atmosphere was lovely and relaxed with a great eclectic playlist. The staff was delightful and we loved watching the chefs hard at work in the open plan kitchen. We spent £170 including two drinks each, cheese board and tip. Very reasonable for a fine dining experience that in my opinion was as good as some of the Michelin starred restaurants I’ve been to. Well worth it for a special occasion. Thanks HK team! Very nice restaurant serving upscale British cuisine. We went there during the week so it was rather quiet, which we actually prefer. The restaurant has a nice bar in the front of the house, where you can enjoy a range of interesting and imaginative cocktails, but they serve classics too. The restaurant part is at the back and you pass an open plan kitchen with bar seats as well, where you can see all the master preparation, it's really interesting! There are normal tables as well obviously, further back.
We had a tasting menu with wine pairing. I really enjoyed the finger food that comes before the main menu, but all dishes were great. Some interesting matches, but also some surprisingly simple dishes like a pasta with butter, truffle and cheese, were absolutely delicious, and nicely paired with the wine. You can taste the quality of ingredients, and masterful preparation just completes the dish. The service is impeccable, friendly and knowledgeable. The sommelier was particularly good, clearly knowing his trade, but also very approachable and nice to talk to.
The whole menu comes to about 8 or 9 dishes, so it's a lot, and we struggled a bit to finish it all!
The experience was very good and I can definitely recommend it. My partner and I attended on a Saturday evening to celebrate her upcoming birthday. My partner is Gluten Free, and Harborne Kitchen went out of their way to accommodate that dietary requirement.

We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we stepped in. We were greeted by all the staff and even the chefs all said allow as we walked by the pass to our seat.

We both went for the tasting menu. And I had the wine pairing. The food was exceptional. Beautifully presented, and each plate was introduced to us by one of the chefs. There are one or two reviews on here complaining about portion size. I think the problem here is common with a taster menu. Especially the Malloreddus. That dish was so good. I wanted to get a big big bowl of it, change into my fat pants, sit on my sofa, and scoff the lot. We were both waddling out of the restaurant after, so there are no complaints from us about portion size.

My only criticism is the tomato course, which is literally a slice of tomato with a couple of onions chucked on. Served with a little bit of stock. I can't understand why it is on a taster menu at a fine dining restaurant.

The decor was nice. The atmosphere was very pleasant. Good vibes all round. And we appreciated the birthday wishes with a chocolate treat. Thank you, Harborne Kitchen. We will definitely be back soon 😋 Amazing! The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was incredible - all the staff were very attention and knowledgeable, Sim in particular was incredibly lovely! We did the 5 for £55 menu which was 100% worth it, each course was absolutely delicious. A few of my friends are vegan and so had the vegan menu and also really enjoyed those courses - although they did comment that they thought some of the courses could have done with a sauce of some kind. But overall an excellent experience, we will definitely be back! A very special place to eat. Excellent, friendly service, very unpretentious and a lovely dining environment.  Second visit last night with a group of friends and all had a great time.  They catered well for a couple of dietary requirements. Wine pairing very nicely done.  Nice to see a couple of the same staff members we saw on our first visit which shows they look after their staff and the staff clearly love working there.

They will help you pour your beer if having difficulty. A little expensive but a pleasant experience. Beer was good. Enjoyed my visit. Staff were lovely! Drinks were even better! Atmosphere was top notch. Good place if you like beer. Great place if you also like a fully stocked bar. Great location. Some pretty good offers too. Brilliant new addition to the Digbeth scene and a must-visit for locals and travellers alike. The process of getting a card and pouring your pints is very simple and easy. The selection of drinks of tap are fantastic (and rotate!), with the owner clearly showing a huge support to local and indepedant breweries/suppliers.
The venue itself is small but cosy, clean and very comfortable. Good concept. Put some funds on a prepaid card, serve yourself and pay by the pour. So if you wanted to try a small glass of 3 beers instead of one pint, you can.

Only 5 taps but your top up card is valid whenever you go back. Fridge of local craft beer, soft drinks and they do coffee.

Small venue tucked in the corner and very close to Z roberto's which does some super rare beers, so this place is cool for a few local draft beers before moving on to other locations. Chance and counters also do some good craft, all within 90 yards of each other.

Aldi consistently delivers great value for money with its wide range of quality products at low prices. The store layout is straightforward, making shopping quick and efficient. I especially appreciate their weekly Specialbuys and fresh produce section. Staff are friendly and efficient at the checkout, helping to keep queues short. Overall, it’s an excellent choice for budget-conscious shoppers who don’t want to compromise on quality. I like this Aldi on Edgbaston Road. The store is generally tidy, well-stocked, and offers really reasonable prices-great for a budget shop! The staff are friendly and the location is convenient, especially if you’re near Cannon Hill Park. My only suggestions would be to improve the tea section (there’s not a huge variety, and it can be hard to find what you’re looking for) and to work on the overall merchandising, as some aisles feel a bit cluttered. Despite that, I’ll definitely be back and will be posting some photos next time to share my finds! I only use this branch when I'm heading to the Cricket over the road. It's your typical Aldi, and it's handy for filling up on snacks and drinks on a match day, but when it gets very busy in there, they only open one till or maybe two, so the queues can build up. There is an ample car park which I've never used, but I would imagine there will be some restrictions in place so cricket spectators don't try to use it for free parking. Staff are just sooooo rude
And unfortunately they seem to.be of the opinion theyre above the customer.  How wrong , how rude.

Perhaps staff training ON MANNERS wouldn't go amiss.

Dusgraceful.

I'll not use the awful store again. Aldi is a fantastic supermarket that offers unbeatable value for money. Their wide selection of products, from fresh produce to household essentials, is of high quality and comes at affordable prices. The store layout is well-organized, making it easy to navigate and find what you need quickly. The staff is friendly and helpful, ensuring a pleasant shopping experience. Aldi has become my go-to supermarket for its exceptional value and excellent customer service.",0.8,0.2,"[""Bar/Pub"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

The entrance was dark and there was a strong cigarette smell.

Our room was worn out, poorly decorated and seemed almost neglected. seems like some redecorating needs to take place. i have attached photographs of the state of the room. Bedding wasn’t clean, many hairs found and mattress was uncomfortable. Didn’t have a pleasant nights sleep, although there was a fan in the room which made the heat bearable.

During breakfast, we were warmly greeted by staff. Food was fine with good options.

Overall, wouldn’t recommend staying here, staff were friendly but it seems that this hotel needs a big makeover. What a brilliant stay! We arrived on a really hot day and our room was lovely and cool. The room was clean and perfect- very comfortable bed too!
The ladies at the reception made us very welcome and were keen to help with advice etc.
Breakfast was delicious, so much to choose from and the lovely gentleman kept checking there was enough food and clearing up - it looked spotless . Overall a brilliant stay. Thank you so much, definitely would recommend- also very very near the Hippodrome! Very nice hotel.
Decent sized rooms.
Very nice menu.
Good variety of food on offer to please everyone.
Nice bar with a good selection of drinks on offer
Close to the train station for easy access.
Only complaint is a there is a disco nearby and might get loud on a Friday and Saturday night.
No problems staying there again!
And more than likely will again next year! I was in Birmingham to see a musical and chose the hotel because of the location. That worked out great as it is like 2 minutes from the theatre. If I was in town for the same reason again I would stay at this hotel again.

The staff was really friendly.

The room was somewhat small and pretty old. No air conditioning and the air smelled stale. The bathroom is tiny. Like after showering I had to dry myself off in the room because there was no space in the bathroom tiny. 3 nights for a work training course.
Rooms were small, tired and a bit smelly. You choose between opening the window and hearing the constant noise from the busy street below and keeping it shut and suffocating.
Training room was ok but ours had almost no natural light. Others may well have been better.
Dining area / bar / communal space was stifling with constant heat, no ventilation or natural light. I skipped most meals to escape the dark, hot oppression.
Food - difficult to say as I'm vegan and wasn't very well catered for. A bowl of veg accompanying a hastily prepared curry tasted strongly of fish ( that was on the main buffet). No dairy free spread at breakfast. If I had an actual allergy, I wouldn't trust the kitchen with my life.
Staff were friendly and efficient which was nice.
I really wouldn't choose to return and am glad to be on a train home...",1.0,0.0,"[""Indian"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Thai"", ""Seafood"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Breakfast""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Communication/Responsiveness"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

He has been in recruitment for many years  and it shows as he is amazing at what he does.  I can't recommend them highly enough. I just wanted to write a brief review as I have just received my official offering in writing for my new job.

During the time that I have been looking for a new role, I have been in contact with several recruitment 'specialists' and Alexander Chapel are in a different league to the rest, on almost all levels.

The level of communication with the team was excellent  and above and beyond my expectations.
I found the interview preparation meetings that you offered me to be highly beneficial along with the advice that was given in between my fist and second interview.

I feel that your expert advice and support has given me the opportunity to secure one of the best roles I have ever been offered and I would highly recommend your company to anyone who is looking to develop their career.

Thank you Never dealt with a recruitment agency before so wasnt sure what to expect but Mark has been super helpful from start to finish. Not a bad word to say and very friendly too.

Great place! Amazing staff! Staff were friendly and informative and the place is absolutely beautiful. Beer garden is preem. We stayed in May 2024. We stopped here for one night as a group of six. The location is fabulous, and the rooms serve their purpose. Great location - close to the city centre. However, it is very noisy, and the window s were single pane, so we didn't get much sleep between the noisy drunk people leaving the town and the sirens. But as value for money goes, it was 5* as it was £100 for 6 people on a Saturday night. I found this a lovely old pub, with a great feel to it. Staff were friendly and attentive, and the sharing platters for our group went down a treat. Their outside area was a bit busier and noisier ... But go inside for a much more relaxed and quieter environment - this place clearly caters for  both!! A little bit out of the city centre, surrounded by some industrial, but I'd recommend. In early March, we traveled from Valencia, Spain, to see a rare band play and check out the city. We were just wandering around looking for a spot for a beer and ended up staying there the whole night because of the really good vibe and how friendly and down-to-earth the staff were with us, even though our English wasn't the best. Definitely, if we're ever back in Birmingham, we'll go back because places like this are just great. Birmingham's oldest pub offers excellent ales, really nice food and a good atmosphere.

I had been to this location before for an eat-in experience and left quite satisfied, so I was genuinely surprised and disappointed by how far the quality fell during my recent Pick Up order via de J&J app.

While the the service was reasonably quick despite a busy period, that was the only positive note. The main letdown was the Lavender Matcha Oat Latte. It looked off from the start — nothing like how it’s marketed, lacking the signature vibrant green and lavender tones. In terms of taste, it was even worse: overly milky with barely any presence of matcha or lavender syrup. These are supposed to be the core ingredients of the drink, yet they were either added in negligible amounts or of such poor quality they failed to register, especially the matcha. The drink was bland, diluted, and uninspiring.

The only saving grace in my meal was the Steak Sandwich, which I did enjoy nonetheless. But unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to redeem the experience. Considering the premium prices, I expected consistency and quality. Instead I received a subpar beverage and overall disappointing order. This visit reflect a lack of quality control and poor attention to the brand’s usual standards.

I don’t recommend this location, particularly for takeaway. It falls to live up to the standards set by other branches. Couldn’t give it less then 1 but it is the worst Joe and juice in Birmingham. The tuna tasted off and matcha was made incorrect. I didn’t even finish off my tumacado beacuse every bite was making me sick I’ve had it before from the solihull branch and they make it right.

The food was just incredible. Seriously, every dish was a hit, but the Gosht Yakhni Biryani was out of this world – so fragrant and the lamb was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The Prawn Shan E Nisha was packed with flavour, and the Lobster Panchphoran? Pure luxury and perfectly spiced.
Beyond the fantastic food, the whole dining experience was amazing. The atmosphere was spot-on, and the service was top-notch. And a massive shoutout to Shubham! That espresso martini he made me was hands down the best I've ever had.

If you're looking for an Indian meal that's a cut above the rest, Asha's is a must-visit. You won't be disappointed! The staff were amazing, very kind and welcoming. Very professional. Decor was very nice, unfortunately the food was not amazing. It was nice. Just disappointing for the price. I was expecting some amazing Indian cuisine experience. Unfortunately we were disappointed. It had been a very nice experience, however sadly we would not return. Nice place, atmosphere was good, service & staff was very cordial and good. Nice deco inside, well spaced.
It's a pricey one though.
Food was good, surprisingly despite eating non spicy Malai Paneer &  roti faced GERD, not sure why.
Qnty is good.
Do suggest to others to try their cuisines. The decor of the restaurant is undeniably impressive, with plenty of celebrity photos lining the walls that add to its charm. I visited with a friend, and we both agreed that the lady who served us was one of the most strikingly beautiful people we've ever seen.

The food was good, but not exceptional—certainly not enough to justify the price. For two curries, one naan, one rice, poppadoms and two drinks, the bill came to nearly £100. There are nearby places like Shababs that offer more flavour at half the price, which really puts things into perspective.

Service was mixed. The poppadoms arrived quickly, but the mains followed before we’d even finished them, making the experience feel rushed. We had to move everything around to make space, which disrupted the flow of the meal. After finishing, we had quite a bit of food left, but no one asked if we wanted to take it home—it was simply cleared away. We then had to wait quite a while to get the bill.

Overall, while it's better than many takeaways and the setting is lovely, I don't think I'll return. The decor is really the only standout feature compared to other Indian restaurants I've tried. I would argue one of the best restaurants close to Birmingham new street station. Service is amazing and so is the atmosphere. Ordered the butter chicken with a side of rice and naan and another chicken dish (I cannot remember the name of it but if it looks good to you ask the server as this was 10/10 highly recommended!!).",1.0,0.0,"[""Indian"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Seafood"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

🍣 Salmon Combo Plate & Nigiri Sushi Set B
Not the freshest sushi I’ve had, and the presentation was rather plain, but portions were generous and satisfying. With more refined plating, it could be even better.

🍱 Children’s Bento
Served in a fun, train shaped tray that immediately caught the kids’ attention! Includes fried chicken, prawn, rice ball, tamagoyaki, fruit, and a cup of apple juice. Well balanced and filling, the kids were delighted!

🍜 Mount Fuji Giant Prawn Ramen
Comes with two large fried prawns and dumplings. Even though the fried items were soaked in the soup, they stayed flavorful. The tonkotsu broth was rich and aromatic without being overly salty.

🍹 Melon Cream Soda
A nostalgic Japanese treat! Classic melon soda with a scoop of ice cream. Tastes great and perfect for photos.

🆗 Chicken Gyoza Mount Fuji is a Japanese restaurant, and since my friend and I love ramen, we ordered the tonkotsu ramen. Honestly, it was just average—I’d give it a 65 out of 100. What was really disappointing was that when we ordered, the staff told us they had run out of chashu for all ramen dishes… and this was right when they had just opened for the day.

The broth lacked depth and richness, which was a letdown. The gyoza and chicken were decent, and the takoyaki was actually pretty good. absolutely amazing service and I love the food, second time coming and I love it every time. super nice waiters/waitresses. I love the atmosphere with the fairy lights and wooden furniture. 1000% recommend Mount Fuji Review: Authentic Japanese Flavors in the Heart of Birmingham

The staff at this location — particularly Harwinder and Adil Suleman — were not only unhelpful but also openly disrespectful and engaged in blaming one another instead of resolving the issue.

I was misled into signing up for a 2-year scheme tied to a phone EMI based on credit checks, only to later discover the information provided was completely bogus. This not only wasted my time but also risked my financial standing. The lack of accountability and customer care is shocking. It’s disheartening to see a once-respected brand tarnished by such unprofessional individuals and poor management.

I truly wonder how such staff can sleep peacefully knowing they’re mishandling customers’ hard-earned money and trust. If this is the new standard of service, it’s clear the brand no longer values its customers. When I first visited the Vodafone shop, they informed me that I could get a SIM-card on a postpaid plan. After three months, I would be eligible for a phone plan. However, when I returned after three months, they told me that my credit history was not sufficient for a phone plan. This felt misleading; it is unfair to tell customers they can receive a phone plan when there is still a credit history check involved.

I had already mentioned that I am new to the country and have no direct debits in my name. Despite this, they insisted that I take the SIM plan, which is quite expensive compared to other companies. For instance, I bought a plan for my wife from EE for just £13 per month, while I am paying £22 per month and still do not have a phone plan.

The staff member there told me to try again after another three months, which further reinforces how misleading the initial information was. I was excited about getting a phone plan after three months, and my wife and I even chose the phone’s storage and color. In the end, however, my credit history was declined, leaving me without a phone plan.

I need this issue to be addressed as soon as possible. I was hopeful about obtaining the phone plan, and now I feel frustrated. If this situation cannot be resolved, I would like to port my plan to EE. Very very terrible staff. My former phone was stolen and I went to change a sim. He just told me to take a phone contract which last two years. And didn’t tell me it only can be cancelled in 14 days. Now I have to pay every month. If you can use other network, just run! Was on the phone with my autistic sister as she visited the bullring Vodafone store. She was served by Saba who she told that she was autistic and was spoken to in the most horrible manner. My sister explained she didn't understand and was told that she can't make it any clearer for her or offer any more support. Horrible attitude and service from her and made my sister feel very unwelcomed. 0/10 My experience with Vodafone was extremely disappointing. Their customer service was completely unprofessional and rude. Not only did they fail to resolve my issue, but they also spoke to me in a disrespectful and insulting manner. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable from a major company.

Siddique mohammed khan Absolutely A1 service today from the girls at Birmingham Bull Ring. So amazingly helpful! Purchased a dress that they did not have in stock to be delivered next day for a very special event :) Went in to try on dresses after visiting the Reiss concession in selfridges and being shown some lovely dresses by a fantastic team member there. She did pick out some lovely dresses for me with one still popping jntj my head when shopping later in the day which I never even looked at when I first arrived on the concession.
Tried them on in the main store instead of in selfridges as I first went round all the shops in Bullrjng to see which options on dresses I had before trying any on.
Sadly the one dress I thought would be the best colour for me (which it was) they didn't have my size available in the store for me to try on. They did get me the same style of dress in the right size but in a different colour to try on and if it was right they offered to offer it for me in the store that day. Sadly I did need the dress in the right colour to try on as the other colour I tried just didn't look right so I couldn't get the best option from trying that on.
Will try to come back when I'm working in town next week to order the dress, both the team members that helped me on the concession and in the store where amazing and very helpful when I was looking around. I just only apologise I couldn't buy the dress because of it not being available in the stores at the time. Would be very happy to come back again and shop to both the store and concession if these two team members are working there.

After purchasing a top and a bag at the self-checkout, I noticed a label on the bag that said something like “secure tagged.” I approached a staff member near the self-checkout area and politely asked if the item still had a tag, as I didn’t want the alarm to go off when leaving the store.

Rather than checking or offering assistance, she responded in a rude manner, telling me to get in the queue. The queue was very long, with only one staff member serving many customers, most of whom were making returns, so it took a long time for me to be seen.

Eventually, when I reached the till, I was asked to step aside while a male colleague was radioed. He brought me back to the self-checkout, scanned the item, and confirmed there was no tag on it. He apologized for the experience, but by that point, I had only a few minutes left to get to work.

I had made my purchase with plenty of time to spare, but the lack of assistance and the dismissive attitude of the initial staff member caused a significant and unnecessary delay. I found her unwillingness to help extremely frustrating and unprofessional.

I am very disappointed by the service I received and hope this feedback will be used to improve the customer experience at this store. Love this place, especially now when there is a lot of place.
The shop is nice and bright, fitting rooms are lovely as well.
Self check out is working great The query at the fitting room is quite long and very discouraging, they need a larger space because of the crowd that comes into the store, it tends to make the place crowded. They have amazing clothes and very affordable and the quality is very good Great shopping experience. Right im the middle of city centre on the main junction of high street. Had to wait in a long que before entering the store. This explains how much people like it.
The store itself is beautifully decorated and has a Great interior. Consists of multiple floors that segregate mens, women and children clothing. In terms of clothing its has more or less everything to cover all events from formals to casual etc. Shoe variety is a bit of question but again its not a shoe store only. In terms of quality its good. Some products are excellent and prices wise its not bad for the quality. In totality its a giod brand. Visited the store yesterday to collect an online order.

And with a 15 minutes window that was extremely poor.

However the comedians were fantastic! having an absolute best time here ever. my favourite room is retro they play all the best songs and has the best vibes in there. very nicely decorated. bar staff are super friendly and lovely. came to the bar on more than one occasion and had the best service. 100% coming back again It was a really good show from the Dreamboys. And they were all nice and were respectful of boundaries especially that I was not that very comfortable since I wasn’t used to that kind of show. But my friends and I had a blast. Special mention to Chambers for being extra kind and polite. Thank you! Came to Rosie’s for my friends birthday. We booked a VIP booth, well worth the money! Sparklers and confetti made it feel extra special. All the staff were polite and made us feel welcome. The manager was very helpful when my friend lost his phone briefly. Great range of music in the different rooms but we mostly stayed in the Dao room. DJ in there was sick!

Good location, within easy reach from anywhere in the city centre.The place is clean and tidy and offers a good choice in snacks.Ordered coffee, and it was ok. Resisted the sweet stuff this time.All good; I will go for more. I visited this café with a friend of mine and the service was not the greatest to put it nicely. Very rude staff.
First of all, the bun that I had ordered was very dry and was lacking in the flavour department.
The chai latte was appalling, it tasted like straight up sweet milk - I would not recommend this especially if you are cultured. There was no spice whatsoever.
The mushroom pastry was decent yet very, very greasy.
And lastly, there was some form of cronut that we had ordered that was so hard and tough to get into - you’d need a chainsaw just to cut it up! Originally we thought we’d take this dessert to go, yet shortly changed our minds. A couple of minutes after, the manager decided to berate us for eating that one dessert in (bearing in mind everything else we had ordered to eat in). Never had a staff member assume the worst like that before and humiliate us for no apparent reason like that in our lives - would never go back! Even after the ordeal, she would keep giving us evils and dirty looks until we left.

In summary, this bakery/café is all show and not all that good in reality. Very much an Instagram vs reality moment - I would only recommend if you’re into being scolded/humiliated and dry pastries! Overpriced hipster place. Price does not match quality unfortunately. Very dry and chewy pastries. Staff could be more polite and welcoming. Will only be visiting again with a free voucher. First visit here and was looking forward to a latte. Their coffee was one of the best I've had. Almond croissants were to die for. It’s our first time here at this Medicine branch. First the shop is quite tidy and really cozy. We ordered maple and pecan bun and mango and passion fruit cronut. It is not my first time to eat cronut, I had it in more upend shops /cafes in London and even in M & S but the texture I know should not be like this. The texture is so dry and quite tough to cut through and taste stale. We even asked the waiter about it if it’s supposed to be like that he just said well it’s a cronut and it’s like that. We did say it’s not our first time eating one. He said it’s probably the kitchen. Not even an offer to change it or what. In short the service was as dry as the cronut we had. The icing on top was too sweet and grainy and more artificial in taste. The maple and pecan was not too bad or great either, better texture but it lacks the maple syrup taste. Money value wise it’s more aesthetics.

We ordered wine, Greek Salad and our main meals , Mousska and a Beef Stifado. The food was absolutely amazing, taking us right back to the greek holidays.
We would definitely recommend this place as a fantastic place to eat. Really quick service prior to going to a show at the Hippodrome. Served within 5 minutes. Really good food.

Best Greek salad in Birmingham!!! All food - delicious!!! (Super extra king 🍤, lamb, beef, chicken, sweets …and much more that you can try …)
One of my favourite place. Also they have second floor for an any events !!!!
Definitely can recommend to everyone, you will never be disappointed. So I was advised not to go to Santorini, so after lots of searching for somewhere for my sister's Hen Night I booked Athens.
Little did I know that when we arrived if was infact Santorini.  Not a good start when some of the Hens had had bad experiences at Santorini.
Anyhow, we arrive after I had booked it over 3 months ago for the table not to be ready (felt like we were not booked).
Tables set for a group of originally 26 but was for 24.  We were crammed in so setting the tables up with activities for the night it was a challenge.all the seat covers were minging and very dirty.

Before the guests had arrived food had been placed on the tables all with  small plates.
Stupidly we thought that we would eat what was on the table, have a break and then onto the mains... how wrong was I... the food kept coming with nothing to serve the food out with, so we were all double dipping.
The food was lovely however we all sat down and 7.40 and food was all out by 8.30.  Most of the food was wasted which is awful in this day and age.  We were offered boxes to take away but how could we, the food had been double if not quadruple dipped and left out for hours.
Drinks service was a joke too we waited ages to be served and when they arrived most drinks were forgotten.
I had travelled from Cannock for this special night and had spent many hours preparing, but was totally let down.  The floor was slippy and two of the guests had slipped badly on the floor and when deserts came, there was no additional plates nor forks or spoons it was a case of hands only.
The tables were full of plates, glasses etc to the point we moved them onto the sides to be able to access the tops of the tables.
Finally, the night was over by 10pm and we were been headed to pay.  We'll what was supposed to be £25.00 each some of us were charged 27.50... the owner wanted us to pay for service so he could pay his staff. This is what he said to me on several occasions.

I feel this place falsely advertises and offer the world when you look at the website.  I was expecting a late night but after arriving for the 7.30pm booking we had all left at 10.30pm.  The DJ was supposed to start at 11pm but that was oviousley not right as all hen parties had left around the same time.  Downstairs had a few people in but apart from.that it was obvious that the night had ended.

I'm gutted as the experience was utterly shocking.  The food was lovely and I feel that the chefs are been let down as the food was really nice but due to the service been poor and rushed with no change of plates nor serving cutlery it was sad.
Finally the floor is slippery and two.of the guests fell and one has had to.go to A&E die.to the fall and once reporting the fall the owner dismissed it and said he didn't see her fall but he has cameras.  No accident book!!!  Also when the plates were smashed those on the dance floor were close to the action and one.of.our guests foot was cut by a plate when it was smashed

If you choose to go as a big group collect the cash before hand and pay in bulk otherwise people will be charged more and perhaps don't bother as its a let down.

They have a great menu with options for all different plant based eaters, including desserts at the counter, drinks and specials. The food tasted fresh, was very flavourful and very well presented.

Their vegan style banana blossom fish and chips & Vegan Kebab burger and chips meals were fantastic! They have a great variety of craft beers available and a wonderful selection of homemade cakes too.

Spent £30 on desserts was told 30 mins waited over an hour and came stone cold nearly any toppings not when paid for extra toppings shops answer is I’ll send you 1 replacement waffle will be going else where in future Not fit for a kids meal my card authorised the payment without it being linked on uber eats McDonalds after As a repeat customer very disappointed with customer service will not be ordering ever again from them they have lost a family of customers now will also be telling my friends not to bother ordering. Was not willing to correct a mistake order. Also ordered from them before and pizza came cold ! I shouldn’t have bothered ordering again after that such a shame ! Don’t bother ordering disappointing service cold pizza and wrong order First Pizza that I was introduced to in Birmingham, 2012. 5/5. Top quality. Consistent. Valued business!

I’m not sure asking to rescan my stamp card counts as aggressive behaviour. Not 1 star because I like Nero. But definitely not a 5 star. She had red hair Very friendly, welcoming staff. Good coffee at just the right temperature. No background music (thankfully!). A bit rough around the edges and the toilet was a bit of a disaster zone, but I think that's every city centre coffee shop toilet is like anyway I love cafe Nero so this not an unbiased review! I use the app in sync with Vitality to get free coffees, although even without a vitality account you have an app with a loyalty card available.

Called in here for a sausage roll and a coffee before starting a busy day. Lovely aesthetics in the cafe, the staff especially the manager/supervisor were all very friendly and welcoming.

Some lovely classical type music was playing, the cafe is spacious with a mix of chair and comfy seating and table styles. All the usual pastries, cakes, bacon and sausage rolls are available as you would expect as well as the whole range of coffees and cold drinks.

Free Wi-Fi available through the cloud with a Sky Wi-Fi sign up and power points for laptops are also available with USB slots as well, on the bench seats look right underneath and you’ll see them!

There is limited outdoor seating available as well.

Based on this experience totally recommend a visit! came here today with my brother and the girl with red hair provided very bad service. very aggressive :/. i am a barista also and i understand nobody is forcing me to work so i don’t take it out on my customers even if im having a horrible day. she was explaining a rule that they have with anger and aggressiveness. i’ve been a regular customer for the past 3 years or so and i will not be visiting ever again.",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

The restaurant itself has a casual feel and the doors open to the street in summer, I can imagine it’s lovely.
The food was spectacular. All expectations were exceeded. The small plates are varied and there are lots of vegetarian options. Each dish was fresh and flavourful. Service also excellent.
Definitely returning again What a perfect start to my day.  Greeted and seated by the lovely max who was very attentive great all round welcoming service (my coffee was perfect really enjoyed it)
I was recommended the hispi cabbage which was absolutely mouth watering unreal flavours very very yummy great amount of chilli oil and the cheese yum yum yum!! 10/10 from me!
I also had lamb maltagliati I have no words WOW YUMMY SCRUMPTIOUS absolutely lovely presentation and taste for both dishes was on point , I will definitely recommend and urge you to have a taste!
Thanks for a great Easter Sunday ill definitely be back again!! I’m so sad I didn’t enjoy the pasta here. I’d heard mixed reviews, and was still wanting to give it a fair chance but unfortunately disappointed. The focaccia was delicious, and the goats cheese / beetroot ravioli  was good, but the main pasta dishes were disappointing. I had the crab devon and my mum had the carasecce which in my opinion was undercooked. The crab Devon pasty was too fishy for me, and the carasecce was bland. The paparadelle had okay flavours , but nothing special. The dessert, was genuinely inedible, the poached rhubarb was still so hard, the nut praline didn’t have a great aftertaste and the sauce was very tart. I felt the flavours didn’t compliment at all even if it had been cooked properly. I would be keen to try the food again, and give it a second chance as I was so looking forward to eating authentic freshly made pasta. We were left so disappointed by our visit to Trentina!

*Edited to add* We have just been made aware from looking at Trentina’s instagram pictures, that the fennel and black pepper sausage starter my friend was served was nothing like it was supposed to be, as it came without the sauce and cheese. Unfortunately we didn’t take a picture of this but it’s deeply concerning that neither the kitchen team nor our server recognised that we were served a dish where 2/3 key components were missing. Completely unacceptable that we paid full price for this.

The vegan version of the radiatori, chestnut, oregano and old Winchester dish was dry and completely devoid of any flavour. There was no vegan cheese on the dish despite being advertised on the menu. We asked our server if we could get some, and she was told by the kitchen there was no vegan cheese available, something that should’ve been communicated to the front of house team at the start of service so they can inform diners in advance of ordering.

Our server was kind enough to get our dishes swapped to the risotto and spaghetti al pomodoro which were better but still not very impressive in terms of flavour.

Our friend ordered the pappardelle and ox cheek dish and it was not served in a sauce, but basically water. He did ask if this was intentional and it was. Same with the pomodoro as you can see in the picture. Truly baffling why it’s so thin, as you can’t quite mop up the sauce with the focaccia, the watery consistency means it just makes the bread wet.

We also witnessed the table across from us reacting negatively to their food, so we know it’s not just us being fussy!

We did however enjoy our starters, very simple dishes but the flavours were there. The focaccia is good. The drinks were also lovely. Visited Trentina twice now and it’s a lovely, cosy Italian spot in the Jewellery Quarter.

I’ve done both bottomless brunch and a regular dining visit and couldn’t recommend both enough!

Service is always excellent and attentive by staff. Carafes of water are regularly refilled and drinks take no time to come out at all.

The pasta is the real star here, though. Handmade on-site (seriously, if you walk past early enough you can see the magic happen!) and always tasty. I’ve only knocked off a star for food as last time I came my spaghetti was a bit on the undercooked side. Could have done with just one more minute or two to make it perfectly al dente!

The store owner was absolutely lovely, helped me and my disabled friend without any need to ask. Food and drink amazing, store has a great selection of singles and a massive play area downstairs Usually not very busy and should be able to find a seat downstairs. Most players come for card games or board games.

The foods are fair. Of course it is not a restaurant, so do not expect a high quality. If for some quick treats, the foods should be more than enough. As someone who visited the old Geek Retreat site a few times nearer the city center (and saw some of it's not so great moments). I can honestly say the staff, atmosphere and new location is a lot better now that they have moved to the Jewellery Quarter.

Staff seem a lot more friendler and knowledgeable, and provide good customer service. And the atmosphere, location, and products on offer feel a lot better.

They have a good variety of card games, board games, t-shirts, and other merchandise to buy upstairs. Then downstairs is a free console playing area and free gaming tables for playing your own card and board games (though some tables maybe reserved for events). There is even a few free card and board games available for use downstairs too.

I didn't try the food at the old or new location, but from what I have seen they try and offer a good variety of snacks and quick food and drink to keep you going while gaming. If you want proper food or have special requirements - there are lots of pubs, restaurants, cafes etc nearby that may server better food if you want a proper meal beforehand.

I have visited twice. Once to look around and I got a nice Pokémon shirt. Then again to get a pre-release for MTG Wilds of Eldraine, some MTG commander decks, and a nice (now rare!) MTG LOTR playmat.

They have lots of other products though (especially themed around then events they hold).

There are lots of events and casual gaming sessions that look fun to join, and most paid  entry events seem to include a booster pack or a drink.

It is very convenient to have this shop in the Jewellery Quarter, as most geeky shops are in the City Centre or Digbeth. The Jewellery Quarter can be a nice alternative, as it a quieter space with nice architecture, so good for those who don't like crowds/busy areas.

The shop is easy to get to by train and tram (never tried it by bus).

If you get a Daytripper/Network Day Ticket from the bus/tram/train/train stations (it costs around £7.90 after 9:30 am - it includes a days unlimited travel by train, tram, and bus, around most of the West Midlands) you can easily have a look at this shop and other gaming shops in Birmingham to check stock and prices, and have fun around Brum.

My only suggestion to staff is that they need to open a window or put a few air fresheners downstairs, as there is not as much air flow downstairs as there is upstairs. As it is a cellar area, it just needs something to help it out when it gets a bit musty. Friendly staff and customers with lots of game related stuff to look at and play. Good variety of hot and cold drinks at a good price too Friendly and helpful staff. Lovely place.

The food is average to good, however, some dishes are quite expensive for what you get in terms of portion size.
It's a posh place and that's what you're paying for; the location, decor and ambience.
Last visit was with a reservation and the place was absolutely packed. The customer service at the entryway was polite, and we were seated immediately.
Once ordered, the food arrived quickly and all was good with that. As we finished off drinks and the table was being cleared, the manager asked us to leave because there were people waiting. However, it was us that were waiting for dessert, which was taking a long time to arrive as they forgot about it. The waiter/manager/guy in suit did apologise for rushing us.
Slightly disappointed with the forgetful service, but it happens when you're rushed off your feet and not all staff are ""on the same page"". Extremely disappointing experience — overpriced, underwhelming, and outright rude.

Let’s start with the host. A very tall Black gentleman (only mentioning for identification, as he wore no name tag) was at the entrance. He walked right up to us, saw us waiting, and didn’t even bother to say hello. It wasn’t until I stared directly at him for a while that he finally mumbled a “hello,” as if I had to beg just to be acknowledged. Basic hospitality? Nonexistent.

We were then refused seating in a clearly open section of the restaurant — lights on, people dining, and absolutely no “reserved” signage. When asked why we couldn’t sit there, the answer was vague and dismissive. Instead, we were led to a cramped, uncomfortable spot. The entire interaction felt cold and unwelcoming.

As for the food? Laughably small portions — honestly, I wouldn’t serve this to a dog. At this price point, I expected at least something decent, but the flavors were average at best. You’re paying premium rates for barely edible, forgettable dishes.

Cold service, inflated prices, microscopic portions, and a general attitude that makes you feel like you’re the inconvenience — Fumo is a hard pass. Never returning, and I’d strongly advise others to steer clear The food was wonderful. Attentive and friendly atmosphere & service. Firm favourites are fried sea food with scallops, lobster pasta, and fried pizza Panzerotti. We enjoyed everything we tried, and we come here often and I'm never disappointed with the food. Would 100% recommend. My only criticism is the lobster pasta keeps getting smaller and smaller hoping this improves. We visited on a Saturday evening at around 630pm, we turned up on the off chance without a booking, we were lucky and got a table straight away. The place was busy so do recommend booking before-hand. It's located right at the top floor of Selfridges.

Service was good but had to wait a while for the bill once we were ready to leave. Dishes are 'portion-sized' between a full course & tapas dish. Whilst the menu recommends between 5 to 6 dishes between 2 people - the sizes of portions were good & depending upon how hungry you are, 4 dishes should be ok. We ordered 5 dishes and were so full, couldn't order dessert!

The food came out quickly and was good & well cooked. The atmosphere was great and the decor really nice. Really tasty food at Fumo Selfridges as always

We had:
Garlic bread with basic and mozzarella
Roast potatoes
Fries
Broccoli
Ravioli Tartufo e Pecorino
Spaghetti Carbonara

Didn’t see the rooms. Want to go back when they have entertainment on. An Unforgettable Night of Jazz at The Blue Piano – Friday, 21st March 2025

I had the absolute pleasure of visiting The Blue Piano in Edgbaston, and what an evening it was! I made the trip especially to see the incredibly talented Dr Stephen Tromans perform, and he did not disappoint. From the moment he and the other musicians took the stage, the energy in the room was electric.

The music was nothing short of breathtaking—rich, soulful, and deeply moving. I found myself listening with my eyes closed, heart open, completely lost in the magic unfolding before me. Stephen Tromans plays with such passion and skill; his connection to the music is something truly special. I was absolutely blown away.

The atmosphere at The Blue Piano only enhanced the experience. It’s an intimate and vibrant venue, perfect for live jazz. The warmth of the crowd, the outstanding musicianship, and the sheer beauty of the music made it an evening to remember. The venue’s commitment to showcasing top-quality jazz acts really sets it apart, making it a must-visit for any jazz lover.

I travelled quite a distance just to see Stephen Tromans perform, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. His presence brought something truly special to the venue, and it was clear I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. I really hope The Blue Piano books him again soon—he and the other musicians created an unforgettable experience, and I know many would love the chance to experience it again.

If you love live jazz in a welcoming and atmospheric setting, The Blue Piano is the place to be. I can’t wait to return for another fantastic evening of music! I was not impressed with the Blue Piano it was cold no atmosphere. Menu on line looked amazing but when we got there we were given  a reduced menu and told they were changing it but unfortunately they didn't let us know, my husband  picked the duck as his main course but the waiter said they didn't have it .What we did have was very very spicy Will not be going  back. An impressive restaurant!
My family and I hired the private function Room here for a surprise 60th birthday party - BP did not disappoint. The venue, food and service was spot as were the attentive staff whom made all the difference. Food was ample and tasty, drinks reasonably priced and the location easy to get to with nearby parking available. All in all a gem. We look forward to our revisit in the near future.

We all had something different to eat.    2 of the 5 people I was with are vegetarians and we were pleased there was a good choice. The staff were friendly and helpful.  We had cocktails and wine, and all were lovely. Lovely restaurant   was my first visit but won't be my last. It was our first visit to Banana Tree and Hemang and Irina were great servers. They were able to speak about the menu, take orders and have a laugh. We will be coming again. The food was amazing 😍. The tofu pad Thai ❤️, bang bang broccoli. We visited Banana Tree Birmingham to celebrate a very special little girl’s 9th birthday, and honestly, it turned into such a beautiful, memorable experience—mainly thanks to the amazing staff, Temi and Franklyn.

From the moment we arrived, they both went above and beyond to make her feel like the birthday star she truly is! They helped us keep the cake a surprise, working with us like secret agents until the big reveal—her face absolutely lit up when it came out, candles and all. It was a moment we’ll never forget.

Although the food took a while to come out, that in no way reflects the team. Temi and Franklyn were consistently warm, attentive, and full of positive energy. They checked in on us regularly, kept the birthday girl smiling, and genuinely made us feel looked after.

A big thank you to Banana Tree Birmingham for the lovely atmosphere, and an even bigger thank you to Temi and Franklyn—your kindness made all the difference. We’ll definitely be back! It’s my first meal in Birmingham. I just randomly walked into this restaurant which the area look relaxing and tidy.

I always go for the basic, Pad Thai. We have ordered a chicken pad thai & a chicken fried rice. The presentation of the dishes is very good, the portions are also enough to be not too full which is just right for a dessert. Pad Thai was as expected very delicious.

However, I have no idea what’s going on with the dessert and I have never tried something like this. The texture of the sticky rice was super sticky and the ice cream doesn’t taste nice.

Food is very tasty - I had the mushroom aranchini and the muhammara dip. Both really tasty and so fresh.

The Hive’s commitment to training young people and growing fresh produce is really commendable and the result is a cafe with delicious food! Wandering around the Jewellery Quarter I stumbled across this delightful cafe.  Fresh gorgeous food. I had a cheese and onion tart and a unique salad. I managed to resist the sweets. Stop in for breakfast, lunch or coffee and a treat. The Hive is awesome! They make everything fresh, and it’s all vegetarian with plenty of vegan options too.

I tried the Masala Scotch Egg with homemade salads and pickles, and wow – it was so good! The egg was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spice, and the salads were fresh, colorful, and full of flavour. The team put a lot of thought into every dish, and since they change the menu seasonally, there’s always something new to try.

The staff are super warm and welcoming, and you can tell that they really enjoy what they do. If you’re into delicious, healthy food with a laid-back atmosphere, The Hive is the place to be. Definitely recommend checking it out! Very strange place.

Have had this place on my list for a long time so finally decided to stray away from the usual to try it out. Although the staff were very friendly, the vibe was non existent and felt very awkward and canteen like. It began as awkward quietness and then became packed with rowdy people.

Food was mid although price was arguably decent

The espresso martini had a great coffee flavour but lacked the usual punch you’d expect from a classic martini.

The oysters were fabulous—nice and big, just how we like them!

The pizza, unfortunately, was a bit underwhelming. It was light on toppings, which made it lack flavor. We also tried the seafood grill main, which really could’ve used some salt, garlic, and chili to bring it to life.

That said, the restaurant itself is beautiful—great atmosphere and setting. Have dined many times at San Carlo over the years living in Birmingham. Food is always good. Wine list caters to all budgets. And they have great seafood dishes.

There are two levels to the restaurant and we were sat at a table tucked away which was great. Lots of mirrors with a ceiling full of artificial roses. It’s over the top but suits the venue and adds to the experience.

Great wine. Lots of Italian choices. We had a couple bottles of the primitivo after a round of negronis (pleased an Italian place can make these well too)

My starter was overdone under the grill. I’ve had the baked aubergine parmagiano many times and this unfortunately wasn’t their best. Monkfish tagliatelle and the shared dessert more than made up for it.

The dessert was three mini portions per person and a limoncello shot for £9 each. Great value.

Will look forward to my next visit. Great food apart from the tomato bruschetta - no flavour and seemed if was rushed it lacked taste but everything else was delish.

The waitress was quite passive aggressive and rude. I wish I didn’t pay the service charge. She was very intimidating. No people skills. Other staff were great. So the food the bruchetta was almost inedible the bread being hard as a rock.

However the rigatoni alla norma was absolutely fabulous one of the best pasta dishes I have had in a long time and to follow the strawberry merguine cake which rains supreme over any cake I have ever had!

It's a shame that before my dining experience i was kept waiting at the door for 15-20mins while the host was laughing on the phone, it really set the tone for service not being checked on during the the meals or having water poured, this however picked up after my main!

Overall it is a nice reasturant with lovely food but the level of service i received was not worth the price especially when similar reasturant fumo is a short walk and offers a much higher quality and more attentive service! Not a particular fan of UK Italian restaurant as my overall experience of them are not very positive. Did book a table on Sunday night as San Carlo is one of the Birmingham signature restaurants. Didn’t expect much but I do think they did a great job. Food was delicious overall and in generous portions which is a bonus. Calamari was good, freshly fried and still crispy with some squid flavour instead of a rubber in most Italian restaurants. My frutti de mare was good, loads of seafood, probably the pasta is overcooked a bit to my taste. But I like the subtle spicy that bring the dish better. Reasonable service, can see some wear and tear from the decor. Price is reasonable considering the portion is big.

I’ve ordered a mango bingsu, which the portion is just right for 2 people to share. Not sure if the sauce is condensed milk or something similar, but it’s adding a flavour to the bingsu which really special. Defo worth coming a long way for this bingsu.

For the oreo tiramisu and hojicha cream roll, I was expecting a creamy and smooth texture. But the tiramisu was solid hard like frozen cheesecake. Even the cream roll, the sponge cake wasn’t soft enough. The cream was very thick and not airy as I expected.

Overall, it’s satisfying to enjoy a nice mango bingsu in a cozy indoor cafe. Would recommend to take a seat and chill. ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡ A Hidden Gem with Exceptional Quality!

This cafe is undoubtedly the best in the area when it comes to quality. While it may be a bit tricky to spot on a sunny day due to reflections, it’s well worth seeking out. We had a lovely short break here, enjoying a pistachio Spanish latte, a matcha latte, and a matcha roll, each one was excellent. Looking forward to returning for more! Recommended! So glad we don’t have to travel down to London for great little cakes anymore, I’d say their cakes rival the likes of WA cafe etc. Looking forward to try more flavours! really kind baristas, and good explanation of speciality beans, which change seasonally. The drinks are not too expensive, I spent around £8 for an iced peach matcha latte with a pistachio sea salt matcha cookie.

I came here to study and it had really ambient, calm, jazz music which wasn’t too loud or distracting. It was a Wednesday morning so it wasn’t too busy.

One downside is that there is no toilet or WiFi :( but the food, drinks, kind staff and atmosphere outweigh this!!

it was my second time here and I‘ll keep continuing to come because it is so nice 🥰 BEST MATCHA in Brum!! They offer both hojicha and matcha lattes (and their variations). Their hojicha and matcha are shipped from Japan and at a reasonable price (£4.3+). Tried the mango tiramisu and black sesame tiramisu and they were both banging!! Very light and slightly sweet,  it’s good portion to share between two. Their original tiramisu contains no alcohol, so it’s accommodating for those who can’t consume it!

There was more salad than meat, and the so-called sheesh kebab consisted of tiny, lukewarm lamb pieces. We spent £70 on three small starters, two portions of chips, and drinks, which felt like a complete waste. While the food had some flavour, it certainly wasn’t enough to make up for the portion sizes and lack of warmth. I wouldn’t recommend this place and will definitely not be returning. One star for flavour, but that's all. This restaurant is very nice. It has lots of lovely food and delicious tastes aswell. If I could I would come everyday just to eat and sit because the restaurant also looks very pleasant inside and out . If I were you I would come and see this nice restaurant!😋 We stumbled accross this little Gem. Originally we went in just for a drink however the food smelt and looked amazing.
The staff were friendly service was very slightly slow however it was very busy and they were rushed off their feet.
Food was amazing we even ordered more mid way through our mains. Price was average 30-40£ for the 2 of us.",1.0,0.0,"[""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Mediterranean""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size""]"

I was extremely disappointed with it. The sausage was incredibly dry, overcooked and cold.  The presentation was also awful. The gentleman (owner) who made the sandwich only buttered half of my bread and didn't cut my sandwich in half properly. I had to do it myself went I go into work. Seems like he has never made a sandwich before. While the service was friendly, the overall quality of the food was simply not worth the price. Been going rustic on and off for years never had a bad lunch highly recommend if about and around livery street area won't be disappointed Food was nice but the lady used her hand to pick the Tuna out of my Jacket potato when she put it on by mistake. A bit too Rustic for my liking. Good food though! - Adding to my previous review because of the dissapointing service.

I went in to get a Jacket Potato. The lady at the counter made another customer a Sausage sandwhich, without gloves and began using the same hands on the vegetarian options I was picking. The Cross Contamination in this place is ridiculous. Im not asking for your hands to be washed everytime but wear gloves at least. I shouldnt have to go into a shop, pay for a service and explain how my food should be made. It's dissapointing because its not the worst place to visit but every visit makes it more unbearable.

The Woman needs to learn some customer service skills as well. Not a smile in sight. You would think if someone is bringing money into your business you would at least force a smile. But not in this case sunshine! Lovely little cafe creating good honest breakfast sandwiches and baguettes plus toasties. A good choice of lunch time bespoked sandwiches and plus a hot meal special most days. Not forgetting a good warm beverage to be had. There are also salad box choices for those watching the calories.

The cafe is situated on a back road and the outside does look a little decrepit but  don’t let that fool you. Inside is a comfortably decorated and quaint little cafe.

I picked up an iced coffee, panini and cookie. The coffee was a generous size and tasted refreshing. The panini was halal.

A great find and I look forward to coming again. I've been twice now, both times the sign in the door says I'm within their opening times, both times the door has been locked.  I left a one-star review to suggest it's closed but the owner has replied to say they are closed for maintenance. I'm changing this to 3-stars as putting a notice on the door/updating google to reflect they are closed (as they obviously check their google page) would be helpful and save wasted journies.

UPDATE JUNE 25 - visited again in opening times, shut again. Opening times have vanished from the door. Putting back to 1 star, unclear if it's shut or not Friday 28 March 2025.
I was with my partner and saw the A board which promoted the £3.50 meal deal. The time was about 13.00pm.
We just about found the place on Cannon Street. It looked derelict from the outside.
We managed to go upstairs. 0 marks for accessibility. Anyone with mobility issues, in a wheelchair or with pushchairs won't be able to access the space, which is up narrow stairs into a large seated area.
The decor might try to give off New York style loft vibes. But it looked dated and dimly lit, cold and dirty like a run down warehouse.
The venue was empty. One person was behind the counter.
I enquired about the meal deal, to be told they were ""sold out"". I thought it's lunchtime, we're diabetic and we needed a quick bite. But if this is sold out, for a practically new eaterie, they need to do better. It's not like the venue was busy or full. There was no-one there and the offer of a meal deal ""sold out"" speaks volumes.

This is not a good start to a new business venture and I can't see it lasting more than 12 months. I got a coffee and hot chocolate and they were both great! Perfect atmosphere to sit and study, with nice friendly staff. EthyOn Cafe is a fantastic find! The cozy atmosphere and friendly staff make it a perfect spot to relax. I loved their fresh avocado toast and latte, and they have great options for all diets. The service was top-notch, and it's a great place to grab a meal or get some work done.

We ordered Kung pow chicken and you could really taste the vinegar. It wasn’t too overpowering though. It was a good balance of flavours. We also had the basa fish dish full of Szechwan flavours. The fish was perfectly cooked, really meaty and moist. The dish wasn’t too spicy even though there were lots of chillis in the sauce but I experienced a delightful numbing sensation on my lips which I was informed by my fellow diner was from the peppercorns. These two dishes were all we ordered between us (approx £8 each) but each came with a side of stir fried vegetables, fluffy white rice and a tomato and chicken soup. It was a feast! We were told if we ran out of these sides we could ask for more. I was tempted to, but I was too full! I really recommend this café and I will certainly like to return to try the other dishes. You can currently eat in at a small number of tables but the café is mainly for takeaway. The decor inside is simple and no frills, (your food is served in takeaway containers even if you eat in) but you’re not going there for the surroundings or crockery, you’re there for the amazing food and hospitality. I was so surprised about the quality of the food, £12 for a 3 meat dishes meal and plus unlimited soup, rice and stir fried veg, I have to give 5 stars and I will definitely go back. Good quality Asian food.
Highly recommended and the owner is a hardworking gentleman. Nice variety of food. My order came swiftly. It was nice. They also do meals which comes with a soup which is a nice touch.

Edit: the spicy noodle isn't as good as before, I'd mainly recommend the rice mains dishes Amazing people, delicious food.

First of all, the coffee was really nice. A fruity, strong taste, leaving a refreshing taste on the palate. But the service. Gentlemen before got a smile, have a good day and some lovely latte art. I got my name said, the name of my drink and milk chucked in. Great coffee, but service not so good. Maybe I've just got one of them faces 😆 The service here was beautiful. The staff were so friendly. Especially Harsha, he helped me decide what sweet treat to get. The pistachio cookie was really good. You could genuinely taste the flavour. Highly recommend. I was seeing a big line for this café every time I passed by, so naturally, curiosity got the best of me. I wanted to see and try why so many people were willing to wait. The café itself is quite small, and it’s definitely hard to get a seat, especially during busy hours. When I finally got my coffee, I have to say I didn’t feel anything particularly special about it. It was decent, sure, but not something I’d personally queue that long for. That said, the staff were very friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy if you manage to get a spot.

What I noticed:
•	✅ Very friendly and polite staff
•	✅ Cozy, warm vibe inside (though cramped)
•	❌ Coffee was average—not bad, just not standout
•	❌ Very small place, seating is limited
•	❌ Long queue, not sure it’s worth the wait

Overall, it’s a decent café with great service, but I’m still wondering what draws such a long line every day specifically young girl. Maybe it’s the hype or the aesthetic appeal, but in terms of coffee taste alone, I didn’t find it extraordinary. Stopped by Blank Street Coffee and had such a nice experience. Callum and Lydia were super friendly and made a great matcha and banana bread! The place was really clean, well stocked, and the air conditioning was a lifesaver. Definitely coming back! Gorgeous flavorful drinks! My partner had the white chocolate matcha which tasted just like it! I had their cinnamon and ginger blend matcha which was super refreshing.

Baked goods to die for! The pistachio cookie was heavenly 😍

Service was super fast despite arriving mid lunch rush - drink was made to order and in my hand within 30 seconds from paying

But this is a lovely setting to go to as a nice date night with a partner & is located near a load of nice bars in Brindley place.

Well worth the money and greatly recommend this place . I went there last night with my family. Very polite staff even though it was their closing time they welcomed us nicely.  Served us great food.  Whole restaurant was packed but the staffs handled everything perfectly. If only Google could give this a zero star review, that's what I would be leaning towards. I rang them up asking for a table, they stated 5 to 10 minutes, obviously due to unforeseen circumstances it was crammed inside, nonetheless, we compromised to sit on a table of 2 with 5 people, asked for extra poppadoms he made a big deal of it, rushed the way they served our food, the waiter was overtly aggressive, even though we were asking for a couple of poppadoms, when deciding to add extra food to our main course, they said no you need order all your food together. If I am a paying customer, am I not entitled to order more food? I asked to speak to a manager and he said the manager was not in which he lied about. Just trying to divert his wrongdoings. Once we found the manager, the manager apologised which the waiter should have done and then we confronted the waiter in a nice way explaining to him how he came across as extremely rude and he then turned around in a bad manner dismissing us in front of the whole restaurant with 'thank you, bye' while he was pointing to the door. I hope anyone else does not have to experience this, but honestly I would not recommend going here. Especially not with your little ones. We spent just above £70 with the service not even worth 70p. ABSOLUTE DISGRACE! As soon as you enter they welcome you with a warm smile and make sure you're looked after. The food was amazing. It was so flavourful and tasty and just the perfect amount of spice. As a south asian myself it's hard to find a good restaurant that truly serves authentically delicious dishes, so this really hit home. Can't wait to visit again! Customer service is just exceptional.

A small operation and the service was unusual. They don’t make the sandwiches in front of you like most sandwich places i’ve visited, so you can’t tell them how much of something to add. The pricing structure is inconsistent and they charge extra for salads. The interior is very small and only seats 4 people but there is outdoor seating. But usually people opt for take away here.

Small sandwiches and barely any filling. Very disappointing. I was still hungry after eating a sandwich. Taste was okay but nothing revolutionary.

Decent for a quick bite to eat if you are unable to make your own sandwich. But overpriced for the quality you get. I went in a few months ago had a lovely sandwich. Yesterday and today I had the BBQ pulled pork with apple sauce and red onion. They were absolutely perfect. The even remembered my name. That personal touch meant so much. Wil definitely go out of my way to go back soon. Cute sandwich bar you could almost miss but glad we didn’t. Just stopped by for a takeaway coffee and samosa, sitting outside in the spring sunshine was a delight. The menu looked good and fab looking sandwiches. Nice area of Birmingham and I’ll return . Great lunches, great service. Really good quality food at very reasonable prices. Really Excellent Quality Sandwiches and fantastic service!

I am a regular at Village Kitchen at lunch time as their sandwiches are of the highest quality and absolutely delicious!  I also recommend their Samosas as well.

Also had the Saffron Spicy chicken on French toast - delicious! Quite Spicy but the flavours were fantastic! Defo recommended!

Overall, we would come back, and once again, service was fab. Thanks to Zaira!",1.0,0.0,"[""Burger"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Ethiopian""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

We got the 2 for 1 deal as we were there early. they have two courses. I'm not sure if it would be great value if we didn't get the 2 for 1. We managed to do the first course without anyone In front of us. The holes are very similar. can be completed fairly quickly if there's no one in front of you. Ryan was an outstanding member of staff—extremely friendly, helpful, and welcoming. He went above and beyond by offering us student discounts and even gave us two games for the price of one. Even though we were a bit lost during the experience, Ryan guided us through it with patience and enthusiasm. His support really made our visit memorable! We played the two courses here in the week, and having gone before 1pm we got to play the two courses for the price of one round.

It's really good fun, and quite tricky! It's quite an immersive experience with a lot to watch and listen to whilst you're playing.

There is a bar & they do food.

They also do student & blue light discounts. Had noticed this place a couple of years ago when looking for activities with the kids, but the lack of a pre-booking system drove me away until I started running out of ideas for places to go.

I turned up at the opening time of 10am and was pleasantly surprised to see there was no queue. Turned out I was at one of two entrances, the main one appears to be inside the shopping centre. The indoor entrance is prioritised to open first, so when we got in and got to the desk, we were shown the actual queue and joined the back of it. Luckily it wasn't too long, and we were handed out chocolates while we waited.

There are two courses, a tropical one, and an ancient explorer one. We did seriously consider doing both, but decided last minute to just go on the tropical one. This turned out to be for the best, as one round was enough for us. It was £40 for us as a family of four. There are lockers which are free to use, where we put our coats.

You play each hole in turn behind other groups, and there's a rule to keep each player to a maximum of 6 shots to keep it moving. You could see some ahead of us ignoring that rule, but I was more concerned with the family behind us who ignored their children getting ahead of them and constantly disrupting our game. This obviously isn't the fault of the venue, but just something to look out for.

It was nice to sit down and relax with a cold beer in their restaurant area afterwards, but I didn't try any of the food so I can't comment on that. Really fun experience for anyone of any age! We took our girl guides on a Saturday afternoon, it was fairly busy but managed well and we had ample time to play our game.

The food was fresh and delicious — I tried a variety of dishes and enjoyed every round.
The system is really unique: you pay around £33+ per person and get 4 rounds to order from the menu. In each round, you select your dishes, and they prepare everything fresh and bring it straight to your table. It’s not a buffet — it’s made to order, and the quality shows. You eat at your own pace, and when you’re ready, you move on to the next round.
The staff were amazing — friendly, attentive, and quick. The atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant, making the whole experience even better One of the best Japanese restaurants in Birmingham! The food here is absolutely delicious — we come regularly and it never disappoints. The atmosphere is always welcoming and the staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating. A special mention to Yan, who always looks after us and makes us feel like special guests every time we visit. Highly recommended! This is THE place to go in Birmingham and the West Midlands to try Sushi. £30 cash each for unlimited rounds of Sushi for a little over 2 hours. Everything on the menu is fair game, prepared fresh and smells amazing.

We will be back. The service and aesthetic inside were nice. We came for the shared dining lunch menu and ordered numerous dishes but honestly the sushi was not very nice and the side dishes were bland / tasteless. I wouldn't come back again. The food is halal which is a bonus. The all you can eat sushi is worth the price of £33.80. There are numerous rules. You have four sittings. 3 dishes per person plus sides over a 2.5 hour period.

We have dined here many times and the sushi roles are what we recommend. They come in portions of two and are made to order. Colourful well presented and tasty. The sushi roll choice was varied and covered all bases you would need to get lots of variety.

The fried dishes like the octopus balls were very fresh just not to the standard of the sushi. The edamame beans also had a few pods of beans which were hairy & older looking compared to the expected vivid green pods.

It’s £33.80 per person. They said to us that cash was “preferred” but offered no card payment alternative. There is a cash machine across the street so this is not the largest inconvenience. Service charge not applied to the final bill.

The service was slower than expected. But I think it’s because we ordered our second sitting after we finished the previous one and therefore didn’t have the “steady stream” of dishes coming to the table.

Would definitely come back. Perfect for a weekend lunch time in the city after shopping.",1.0,0.0,"[""Japanese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Dietary Options""]"

The female Indian cashier with a black bun behind the counter has made previously rude comments to my 2 friends who frequent the business regularly, we have brushed it off thinking it was an off day for her. We all work hospitality ourselves so this is nothing new.

However, we came in again the other day and she was serving us with the exact same rude and demeaning attitude, she called my friend ugly to her face and criticized my other friends subway order!!!

In hindsight i was too nice, i genuinely have no idea what compels a worker to do something of this magnitude, whether she is targeting us specifically, or if she acts this way to other customers too, and i am writing this review to alert the store management. Located in Jewellery Quarter, reasonably the prices are little bit higher than other Subways nearby. A small one, not many seats to dine in. The food quality is fine.

I hardly give 1 star, but this is unacceptable for me. The Subcard machine is irregularly broken here, with different issues every time. Even when it is working, the staff will always refuse to redeem any items with my points.

As a regular Subway customer, I really despise their behaviour and attitude. They should get this issue fixed as soon as possible if they care about it, otherwise you know what they are actually thinking and all I can do is staying away. I encountered a series of issues that left me disappointed. Firstly, the store closed nearly an hour before the posted closing time, inconveniencing me and others who expected to enjoy a meal within the regular business hours.This is not the first time for early closure. It has happened multiple times where instead of 8pm they have closed it at 7pm.

Furthermore, when I did manage to place an order, the quality of service declined noticeably. The staff seemed in a rush, resulting in poorly cut bread that affected the overall enjoyment of my sandwich with considerable less salad on my sub.I told the girl that this bread is not cut properly and it is broken from everywhere. She clearly ignored my concern. It appeared that the employee was eager to conclude their shift quickly, sacrificing the quality of the food and customer experience Won't be eating here again. On both occasions the bread seems stale and very hard. Worst subway in brum. They don’t accept points here.

It’s worth noting that it’s free at the point of entry which for many families I’m sure is a huge bonus when entertaining children. And there is so much within this museum to entertain young and old with a new exhibits on the top floor focused on Birmingham and it’s history.The Ozzy Osbourne display will attract many people I’m sure. It wasn’t for me but it didn’t distract in anyway the enjoyment of the museum well done to all.  It’s located in the heart of the town hall square with good access to all the shopping areas. Great to call in on a rainy day or a hot baking day. A very good shop which is not something I would ever say but it’s worth visiting and so is the cafe set in the great hall. It’s huge with a great selection. The museum is still only partially open, but there's enough to make a visit very worthwhile.  There are some excellent works of art,  along with exhibits showcasing Birmingham's industrial past.
The building itself is well worth close examination.
There is a shop here,  and also the Edwardian Tea Rooms.
The coffee was mediocre,  while the muffin I bought had all the characteristics of having been made at the same time as the tea rooms.
Prices are high in the tea rooms (£7.35 for substandard coffee and cake), while items for sale in the museum shop are also priced to appeal to those with higher levels of disposable income. (It's not a given that everyone who enjoys art and history also enjoys over-paying for everything...)
Aiming high with prices is fine if quality and value match the price point. I don't think it does here - call me picky, but discerning also fits...
The museum and gallery are 5-star, and entry is free,  but whoever sets the prices for what's sold here needs to better understand the concept of value to the customer. Get that right, and the required profits will naturally follow... I visited Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery today and had a really great time. The building itself is beautiful and full of character, with impressive architecture that makes you feel like you’ve stepped into another time.

The Pre-Raphaelite collection was definitely the highlight for me. The artwork is stunning and well presented, with just enough info to give you context without being overwhelming. There’s also a great variety of pieces throughout the museum, from historic artifacts to more modern and local art. It’s a nice mix that keeps things interesting.

All the main areas were open during my visit, which was a nice surprise since I’d heard some parts had been closed previously. Everything was well laid out and easy to navigate.

The restaurant on site was a big plus. I stopped in for lunch and was really impressed with tasty food, decent prices, and a relaxed atmosphere. It’s a good spot to take a break and recharge.

Staff were friendly and helpful, and the museum is free to enter, which is incredible for the quality of the experience. Whether you're into art, history, or just exploring interesting places, this is well worth a visit. I’ll definitely be back again. Birmingham is lucky to have a space like this. A fantastic museum that is free to enter. During the time surrounding the Back to the Beginning event there is a special exhibition dedicated to Ozzy Osbourne, this is a fantasist exhibit for music fans and one that cannot be missed when exploring the city and learning about the history of Black Sabbath. Situated in Chamberlain Square, it’s easily accessible from Birmingham New Street Station and surrounded by other key city attractions.

Offers a wide range of liquids and mods at a reasonable price. Ordered online numerous times also, arrived within 2 days. Glad I found this shop, when I visited recently at Birmingham and the customer service is impeccable and very pleasant person, as I was really nicely greated and also very well versed about his business and products.

The whole display of the flavours and other bits are nicely presented in the shop floor and prices are very competitive too but honestly dispite expensive or inexpensive the experience at his business worth it.

I'm very picky about my flavours but my brand is nasty juice no matter and this place has it all and in good amount, I was not disappointed at all.

Sir, keep up the good work ethics, God willingly you will go far, stay blessed and keep thriving my friend. I'm honestly glad I found this guy business and I will be visiting  whenever I'm done for sure once again thank you and keep it going just like that.

This is my go to spot for any Chinese non bubble tea drinks as their smoothie, Yakut and cream cheese series are known to be super authentic - and they’re super refreshing and delicious!

They also have delicious pastry items, fresh cakes to order (highly recommend) and the viral mango pancakes and crepe cakes.

Well priced, clean and service is average so a great spot if you want something a bit different.

Note that there’s a £5 minimum spend on card I ordered 2 of the grapefruit bubble tea but when I tried it, it tasted like orange very different from when I had it before, as well as its visual looks which was different from previous purchases...I ordered a another grapefruit tea right after which there was another staff who had made it looked completely different and was better and exactly what I wanted. Therefore I'm not happy as the first two I ordered were made wrong by the other staff. My new favourite place, I want to try one of the big cakes next time I have event. Good quality food and drink here. Clear ingredients for the bakery items too. I had the passion fruit iced tea, I wouldn't say it was boba, it had coconut fruit jelly instead of boba, but it was nice. Nice and clean too. Disgusting bubble tea! Ordered the Oero bubble tea and what I got in reality was very different from what they advertised the drink would look like. There was no oero in my drink at all it was just plain tea! I could have made this myself with a teabag and water. I have attached a picture of what it was meant to look like vs what I actually got. Got scammed for a £6 drink.

Thankyou for putting up with us 💓 Merlin’s Cafe Bar in Birmingham is a fun, quirky spot for horror and fantasy lovers. The spooky decor, themed cocktails, and creative food make it a great place to hang out. The vibe is awesome, the music is on point, and the staff are super friendly. Service can be a bit slow sometimes, but if you’re into cool atmospheres and unique drinks, it’s definitely worth a visit! Merlin's Cafe Bar Review

I recently visited Merlin's Cafe Bar and, unfortunately, it was a bit of a mixed experience. Despite the place being nearly empty, the food took a surprisingly long time to arrive, which was disappointing. When it finally did, it was no better than average—nothing particularly memorable.

On a more positive note, the service was friendly and attentive, which was a real saving grace. The staff do their best, but it’s a shame they aren’t backed up by the quality or efficiency of the food.

The decor is definitely a highlight. It’s well done and provides plenty to look at while you wait—something that came in handy given the delays.

Overall, Merlin’s has some potential, but the food needs to step up to match the good service and appealing atmosphere. Before I got terribly sick, myself & my partner went to Merlins Cafe Bar a new horror theme cafe/bar and the food was unbelievable I very rarely come on here and talk about my food experiences but this place deserves the hype.

My partner got the All day breakfast which has amazing fresh sausages, I got myself a chicken burger with American style thick cut bacon and my god, it has to be the best chicken burger I’ve ever eaten in my life. You know in ads where you see someone bite into a burger and it gets a crunch? this had it, I’ve never experienced anything like that before. The chips were amazing too reminding me of my the chips my Nan used to cook which sent me into a flashback just like in ratatouille where it sent me to being a kid again they was lovely and very well cooked. We also got a portion of macaroni and cheese croquettes which we’ve had in other places before and have let us down so was worried but after the first bite that worry was gone. The food was all fresh & you could taste it.

We got both a homemade cake which was beautiful too. The service was amazing the owner came over spoke to us about his journey, music & more.

Again I cannot suggest this place more and that’s why I’m taking the time to write this out so more people will go check this place out! Absolutely love this place. Decor is fantastic if you like a bit of the macabre & horror. I've been there twice and the music was always great (mainly varieties of Rock). Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Also, the food was fantastic each time! Chicken isn't usually the most exciting meat but both the tenders & wings were succulent & very tasty as were the fries. I've also had the brisket which was melt in your mouth and tender. Prices are also reasonable for the location. It's also family friendly as long as you don't mind a bit of Halloween. I've been once with my daughter (13) & a second time with the family including the grandparents & my 9 year old boy - all loved the vibe and atmosphere but we both my kids enjoy horror movies & rock / alternative music. Great place to eat, drink & hang out especially if you are a bit alternative (though I am sure all are welcome). There aren't many places for us alternatives, but this is certainly one!",1.0,0.0,"[""Burger"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Breakfast""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

Table wasn't ready,  ordered a drink and by that time is was ready.
Sat in a nice corner table (as 4 of us),  server was really friendly, helpful and had out food out in no time.
We all enjoyed our burgers, wings and waffle fries,  beer on tap was refreshing and tasteful.
Only minus point - i found the small wooden stools at our table to be a little uncomfortable ( as 4 of us, 2 sat on the cushioned seats, 2 on stools).
Overall, I will definitely return - really enjoyed every aspect in service, food and ambience. Five stars for HANBAO! We absolutely loved our food—burgers were juicy and full of flavour, the dirty fries were next level, and the cocktail selection was spot on. The staff were super friendly and gave us some great recommendations. The atmosphere was amazing—very cool vibe throughout. Definitely coming back next time I’m in Birmingham! Really quirky mix of Asian and western industrial decor, and the most phenomenal food.
We had the special, which was pancakes with burgers, chicken, cheese and all the trimmings. We paired it with miso fries and salt, pepper wings.
Utterly gorgeous, and coupled with the attentive friendly service, I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Digbeth. Now this place is excellent all the time, love the atmosphere, decor (except sometimes the lights above some tables can be a bit bright/sharp), staff, the food (of course) the cocktails 😈 but a special mention for the Pancake Tuesday special - the Panbao. Out of this world, patties and chese wrapped in pancakes with all sorts of other stuff going on and DRENCHED in maple syrup though still not overpowering the rest of the burger. See my pics and drool over this beut.

I'll be back, of course, but oh my word definitely for Pancake Tuesday!!1! Plently of free parking outside after 6pm but carparks a short walk away only £4 all day or less.
Close to other activities  like go ccarting and ghetto golf.
Easy to reserve online.
Greeted my a lovely  enthusiastic  gentleman  who made me feel excited to be there. Very friendly.
The waitress was also polite, friendly and helpful.
( I'm  not much of a burger person but we went because  my husband loved going with his friends)  Handao MADE me a burger person! From the first bite, it was the best burger I had ever tryed.
We ordered 3 burgers because they all looked great!  3 burgers, 2 sides and 2 alcoholic drinks came to £60.  The meal and service and atmosphere  IS WORTH IT!  Obviously  couldn't  finish it all and the staff where happy to let us take away the rest.

The pastries are one-of-a-kind — rich in flavor, beautifully made, and absolutely delicious. The coffee is just as impressive — perfectly balanced and spot-on every time. It’s the kind of place that makes you want to slow down and savor the moment. Highly recommend! Great GAIL’s experience.

I had high expectations for Gail Coffee, but unfortunately, my experience didn’t live up to them. The long queue was poorly organized, likely due to the setup. Some people seemed to hold up the line, standing there trying to decide what to order, which only added to the delay. Once they had their drinks, they continued to linger, making it harder for others to decide quickly and move through the line faster. It felt like they tried to squeeze as much as possible into a small space, but this only made the situation worse. Also, based on the price, the coffee didn’t stand out in taste—it wasn’t anything special. Went in to try the advertised strawberry iced tea but they’d sold out. Had to ask if they had any others!! Surely it’s a selling technique or basic customer service skills to offer an alternative! They told me about a raspberry iced tea. Neglected to mention it was sparkling and literally from a can.

Well done guys👏🏾👊🏾 I absolutely love this shop. It's my number 1 stop for all my American snacks. The pricing is more than fair, the staff aren't just friendly, they're also really helpful. Sometimes I get lost in their wall of choices.  Gets better and better each time I come down here.

Let's be honest, we all want to try that American Corn dog... Come see for yourself the great range they have 🥰 Shop looks way bigger online, they didn't have baskets so wasnt able to get as much as I wanted, only as much as I could hold in my hands. there was also no prices on any thing, if there was prices I would have got way more stuff so I knew what I was spending, I was talking to the people who work there and they commented on 1 product I got ( PB&J popcorn) that they wanted to try, but didn't want to pay the £7 for a bag In case they don't like it, but they expect us as customers to do it though 😂 the alcohol section and tobacco section was way bigger then the candy section. And TBF there wasn't much choice in American candy
My brother paid almost £30 for just 4 drinks. Expensive beers, don't accept the excuse that it's because they're craft beers. Should be a load cheaper.  Also check out the sell by dates.

It is worth mentioning that the pizza is served on Wednesdays from 5pm and on Saturdays from 12pm only.

Edit- The Nduja special is amazing!! Went there on a Wednesday after work to enjoy their food night. The place is located few minutes from central station but yet slightly hidden so it’s not too busy or loud. The food was good. We took 2 slices and it was too much. They are really rich and filling! If anything, I would rather recommend getting the garlic bread.
The drink menu is full! I loved that the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I was able to taste a bit of the tap drink I was going for to ensure that I would like it. If you tell them what you like, they can recommend you suggestions and I loved that.

I was the first customer at 10am and within 20 minutes the place was packed out. It’s probably one of the best coffee places in Birmingham. The servers were friendly and helpful.

When we finally decided to give this halal hidden gem in Jewellery Quarter a try, we were pleasantly surprised by the delightful experience it offered.

After passing by the restaurant numerous times in the past, we mustered the courage to step inside today, and we were met with exceptional service and delicious food options.

Upon perusing the menu, we sought the guidance of the friendly staff to help us decide on 2 chicken shawarma items. The prompt delivery of our order added to our positive first impressions of the place.

The first dish we sampled was the delectable chicken shawarma served with a side of creamy houmous, while the second was a delightful chicken shawarma wrap brimming with crisp salad and flavorful sauces.

Both dishes exceeded our expectations, boasting juicy and mouth-watering flavours that easily warranted a perfect score of 10/10 in our books.

In addition to the scrumptious fare, we also indulged in a cup of saffron tea, which, though not to our liking, piqued our curiosity to explore other traditional hot drink options on our next visit.

The large menu at the restaurant caters to a wide range of tastes, guaranteeing that there is something to please every palate.

Furthermore, the availability of off-road paid parking ensures a convenient dining experience for patrons.

The hospitable and accommodating nature of the staff further adds to the inviting ambiance of the establishment, making it a point to always seek their recommendations for a more informed and enjoyable dining experience, especially for first-time visitors like us.

One of the staff was very well mannered and polite, another was the exact opposite. Coffee was better than average.

Lovely hot chocolate and coffee.

Plenty of nice relaxed seating, quiet relaxed atmosphere. All staff friendly and efficient. Place and tables all clean and cleaner than most branches. Even though this branch is in a mall it doesn’t feel like you’re in a corridor of a mall.

Great branch. Used to love this Nero – great location and one guy used to make my drink just right. Then he got moved for “affecting stock levels,” which seemed over the top.

There’s a woman (maybe the manager?) who’s often in a bad mood. Once said “Back again?” like I had no other choice. Saw her tell another customer they couldn’t get more milk without paying extra because it messed with her stock count.

Prices keep going up, and with that kind of attitude, it’s hard to justify coming back. Shame, because it could be a great spot with the right team.

This is a party place and people going for it. Not for anyone seeking a quiet time for sure.

Security was tight but polite.

Drinks were reasonably priced and there are people were having shots from trays that were bring brought around.

I think people will enjoy this if they are seeking some fun.

Dj had an mc also and this worked well with the crowd playing popular r n b soul house and garage mostly.

Mainly groups of females I would say. Had an unforgettable time at Bierkeller for Oktoberfest! The atmosphere was electric, with traditional Bavarian music and the staff dressed in festive attire, making the experience feel authentic and fun. One of the standout moments was receiving cocktails in pint sizes—definitely a pleasant surprise and a great value!

The food was equally amazing. Along with classic Bavarian dishes, we were given a giant, soft pretzel that was the perfect pairing with our drinks. Everything came together to create an incredible night. If you're looking for a lively Oktoberfest experience, Bierkeller is the place to be! Great atmosphere for larger groups. They sell steiners at a reasonable price. Vast number of pool tables at £10 per hour and two dart boards. I recently visited Bierkeller Birmingham for their Bavarian night with a group of friends on a stag do, and unfortunately, it was a bit of a letdown compared to what we remembered from our university days. In the past, the Bavarian night had a full band performing, creating a lively and fun atmosphere. However, this time, there was just one man (who did his best to be a good host) and one woman, who didn't really add much. As mentioned, the host really was trying and he was fairly funny, but overall it was just a bit “meh”.

At £20 per person, we were expecting a more engaging experience, but it felt lacking in comparison to previous visits. The energy just wasn't there, and despite the host's efforts, it didn't live up to the excitement we were hoping for.

My friend and I visited Upper Crust, expecting a fair deal from their Too Good To Go offer, but what we got was anything but. We were handed just two meagre sandwiches, a far cry from what was advertised. When my friend politely pointed this out, the staff responded with open hostility, speaking to them with an attitude that was unnecessarily rude and dismissive. And then, as if one wasn’t enough, another member of staff jumped in, doubling down, backing up the rudeness like it was policy. The whole encounter left us shocked and frankly appalled… What a lovely atmosphere! Staff Megha and TT were really nice, friendly, and welcoming. The coffee tasted great, and the muffin was lovely. The only thing is, the prices are a little too high.I think it would be great to see more meal deals at affordable prices. A first rate outlet. My latte coffee was delicious.

The food was amazing and as it was a Thursday lunchtime it was quiet, so felt like we had the place to ourselves. Highly recommend, and my thanks to the team. This was a wonderful indulgent treat, gifted by a good friend. We had a 3 course lunch, where the plates were small, but there were so many little extra courses we certainly did not leave hungry.
For me the many tasters was wonderful as I can get bored of one large plate that loses its individual tastes.
The service was immaculate, I even had a footstool for my handbag! Wonderful place to celebrate our Ruby Anniversary!  All the staff made us feel so special, their friendliness and all the little extras.  They are a lovely group of young people with enthusiasm and a real warmth and passion for what they do.  The food was exquisite as usual and the setting just glorious. Cannot recommend highly enough! Firstly I would like to say the food was exceptional as always. The issue was the service. On arrival we were seated in the garden and provided with drinks menus for a pre lunch drink. After 10 minutes of waiting for a waiter I had to wonder round the restaurant looking for someone to take my order. From this point everything went fine until after the third course. Nobody removed our dirty plates, nobody came to offer coffee. Again I had to leave my seat and go and search for a member of staff, only to find four or five staff members congregating around the bar having a chat! Even after I commented that we were feeling somewhat abandoned there was no apology. As it was my friends birthday lunch I didn't want to discuss it further at the time so I just paid the bill and left with our dirty plates still on the table. This may seem like a small thing, however when I am paying nearly £200 per head, including a £45 service charge, at a Michelin star restaurant I would expect exceptional service. I have been dining at Simpsons for several years and always found it a wonderful experience. Sadly I think this will be my last visit as personally I go to restaurants such as this not only for the food but for the theatre. Having to wonder around looking for staff on two occasions really ruins the sense of occasion. I recently celebrated my 30th birthday with Simpsons, as a surprise from my friends.

Wow.

The welcome, the service, the drinks, the food all fantastic and an experience I’d recommend to anyone. Everyone who looked after us was brilliant. Thank you for making the day so special for me/us.

The room was tired and looked as if it gets zero maintenance. I asked for a double but had 2 single beds pushed together they were not secured so separated during the night causing a gap. I was concerned with the hygiene of the room as there were cobwebs above the mirror and ceiling. The light pull cord was filthy and there was no handle on the inside of the shower. Lighting in the room was awful they still use the old bulbs which emit yellow light the main ceiling lampshade had dead flies inside. I mentioned all this to reception who offered me another room I declined and requested its cleaned tomorrow. When I retuned next day after room was serviced it was exactly the same very poor housekeeping standards. Bar and restaurant is across the road in the main centre very pleasant but mega expensive i.e. bottle of pale ale £6.50. There are no bars or shops near so its a long walk or taxi every time you need to go out if you dont drive like me. The price was very good compared to city centre but by the time you add all the extras its not much of a difference, next time I will pay city centre prices and have a more comfortable stay. Really nice smart new hotel. Rooms were very nice clean and comfortable. Service throughout was friendly and efficient. Breakfast was very good. Especially the sausages. Plenty of car parking and perfect if working on campus or at a conference. I am on my second night here in Lucas House and have not been impressed with the level of accommodation. The room has a draft  from the window which with the low operation of the radiator makes sitting on the work desk cold. Then they decide not to inform me that the dining room is closed all weekend which was one of the reasons of booking the hotel and not a b & b. Seems if you are young and fit the rooms here would suit but some rooms are a long way from entrance and I find little way to get to them apart from walking up two separate staircases.
The staff are friendly and probably are the only reason this hotel can keep going.
Third day and heating has Improved although still not overly impressed with the room. Sorry to say but not a Hotel of choice and I will be looking for other accommodation for my next stay in Birmingham. Rooms were clean, basic. Breakfast was decent.

Was a bit sceptic
at first cos the restaurant was practically empty but boy oh boy were we in for a treat. The food was so good. The salad, spring rolls, soup and chicken teriyaki were 💯. The ice cream was a big let down though. All in all a great experience. I had high hopes for this place, but in my opinion, it was extremely average, dare I say a little below average to be honest and I’ve been to much better restaurants. My family and I had the sushi buffet. This was my first time coming here and it will be my last as well unfortunately. But I’d love to express my honest opinions about this place!

The positives were that the staff were fairly friendly, doing their job as they should. And although I didn’t have the teppanyaki, the people who did have it seemed to be enjoying it and the atmosphere and the performance from the chefs over that side of the restaurant seemed nice. However, I can’t say much about the teppanyaki since I didn’t have it.

On the other hand, there are many areas where this restaurant could improve in my opinion. First of all, the food quality is nowhere near as good as it could be. It’s very average and feels a little lacklustre, as said by not just myself but my family as well. We were served a sushi platter, some prawn tempura and noodles. The best thing out of the things we ate at the restaurant was the actual sushi. It was at a better standard than the rest of the food in my opinion. The prawn tempura was okay, nothing special, but the noodles were not what I expected. Perhaps I am in the wrong for expecting something else but we got Chinese style stir-fry noodles. I work in a Chinese takeaway so I’m aware what Chinese stir-fry noodles are like. So it was honestly very average tasting. We decided to leave after trying the noodles because we really weren’t feeling it. Another thing I’d like to say is that the sushi conveyor belts weren’t used which was a little disappointing but not a big deal for me. However, I did read some other reviews that say that they never turn the sushi conveyor belts on, which is a shame.

Overall, it was a very average experience and I wouldn’t come again, mainly because the quality of food that I experienced just isn’t up to my standard. Every restaurant has areas of strengths and areas of improvement. So I just wanted to express my honest review of my experience as unbiased as possible. Thank you to the friendly staff who served us today! We went in hoping for a conveyor belt sushi buffet, as advertised very clearly on their website, only to find the belt empty and turned off. They never turn it on apparently, despite it being one of their main USP’s. Second red flag, an empty restaurant with dim to non existent lighting. Regardless, we had a filling meal for the price (about £16 a head), although I found the sushi here excessively sweet for my liking. The server’s were polite and attentive, but this will likely be my first and last visit. Came here for a date night. The experience and the atmosphere was so light and fun. The chef that we had was very funny and made us all fell included which is important for an experience like this one. I would definitely recommend coming here hungry as the portions are quite big.

I had to ask the bar woman and she cleared and cleaned our table promptly. I can’t fault the service. The food was tasty but not much to brag about. We had the bangers n mash(could have added more peas- the gravy was good 👍🏽) and gammon steak meal with egg(could have been presented better, the look like someone had cut of the egg white and left just the yolk) with two large glass of Diet Pepsi. The drinks selection was great, you get a good amount per glass.
The ladies toilets need urgent maintenance work. Toilet seats and door locks need looking into and again it was that cold you could see the steam coming from the toilet bowl after it was used😮 Good food and good service, little cold with the smoking area open out the back.
Plenty of option on the food menu which is quite tasty.
Match was on and there wasn’t much atmosphere. I went here to watch football and have a couple of drinks with my partner whilst our young son had a bite to eat. We were happy with the atmosphere and the service was fast even though it was really busy. We ordered via the qr code and drinks came quickly. Our son’s food was a very good portion size for a kids meal and tasted really nice. Lastly, the drinks and meals are priced very reasonably. Came here for some food and drinks after comp, 10 people. good price and the food was fantastic, service was great. compliments to the chef Jordan for a really nice meal Really wish I had taken a picture of the food...

I ran out of online options, and the shop was my last resort, as I couldn’t even book an appointment online due to the blocked account.

Absolutely Horrible Experience at Apple Birmingham – Unprofessional Staff & Rude Manager

I had one of the worst customer service experiences of my life at Apple Birmingham (Bullring) today, and I feel compelled to share this to warn others.

Last night, I successfully applied for Apple finance online to purchase a new iPhone. The application was approved, and everything was set up for me to collect the phone in-store. When I arrived today, I asked one of the staff (who was not wearing a name badge and looked very unprofessional) if I could swap the gold model for a white one. He casually said, “Yeah, no problem,” and asked me to wait.

I waited 45 minutes, only for him to eventually tell me he needed to process the swap through a refund. He seemed confused and unsure of what he was doing, and without clearly explaining anything or getting my final consent, he pressed the refund button and cancelled the order. I was shocked and confused. He never explained that this would cancel the finance and force me to apply again. I assumed (as any reasonable customer might) that the credit would remain in Apple’s system and I would simply choose a different phone.

As a result, I had to reapply for finance. This triggered another hard credit check, and unfortunately, my application was declined the second time – despite having been approved just hours before. So I walked out without a phone, with a damaged credit score, and a lot of time and money wasted (transportation, parking, and half my day gone).

Naturally, I asked to speak to the manager. A woman named Barney came over and instead of showing any empathy, she blamed me, saying the staff member “isn’t a finance specialist” and that “I should’ve known better.” Her tone was rude, dismissive, and condescending throughout the conversation. I explained that if her staff member isn’t trained or authorized to handle finance-related procedures, he should never have processed anything in the first place — especially without my informed consent.

I asked for the name of the staff member who made the mistake, and she refused, saying she needed to “protect her team.” When I insisted — because I have every right to know the name of the person who caused this issue — she got visibly irritated and aggressive. She even challenged me, saying, “Call Apple. Do whatever you want. I’m the manager.”

This is not the Apple I’ve known or expected. The whole situation was a mess — zero accountability, zero professionalism, and zero respect for customers. A staff member made a critical mistake that affected my credit score and my ability to purchase a phone, and the manager not only refused to help but also behaved unprofessionally and with hostility.

I will be filing a formal complaint with Apple directly, and I sincerely hope they take action to improve the level of customer service at this store. Holly was super friendly and helpful when I came back to the store after a problem with my apple watch purchase. She was also so patient when solving the problem and took the time to explain things really well. I hope she gets a lot of praise and recognition at work cos she deserves it x.

I was immediately taken back and rather offended. I asked to view the bracelet but the staff member just looked like she couldve killed me. She was really uninterested and actually scared me away. Shame because they lost a sale of over £100. I will instead purchase through the actual brand’s website and not on next.

Also the food came cold not fresh anymore and also very very dry, i been a customer since times and today is very disappointing. Lastly i ordered the garlic sauce and garlic n herb but they only gave me garlic n herb saucand some other sauces that i didnt ask. Making me dont wanna order from online platforms again, maybe its better to order in person…. :( I’ve been craving a good shawarma for ages, but let’s be real — they usually don’t hit right. Either the spices are way too overpowering, or the flavour just isn’t there. So when my friend mentioned a new takeaway called Dr Shawarma that opened just 5 minutes from where I live, I wasn’t in a rush to try it. I thought, “Here we go again, nothing new.”

But tonight hunger hit hard, and as I was driving down Bristol Road, I spotted Dr Shawarma and thought, “You know what, let’s give it a go.” I told myself I’d get the chicken shawarma meal — and if it flopped, at least I’d still have the chips to fall back on.

There was a bit of a queue, but it moved quickly. The staff were really friendly, and I got my food quicker than expected. Now here’s the real moment… I opened the shawarma not expecting much, took a bite and OH MY — absolutely delicious. The flavour was spot on, tasted genuinely like something you’d get in the Middle East. It had that perfect balance of spices, not overpowering at all. And the chips? Fresh, crunchy, and actually worth mentioning!

I honestly loved it. I’d give it a solid 8/10, and trust me, that’s the rating I’d give even in the Middle East.

Well done, Dr Shawarma. You’ve impressed me, and I can’t wait to try the rest of your menu! Dr Shawarma is a place I could easily eat at every day—breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The shawarma here is hands down the best I’ve ever had, incredibly flavorful and fresh. The variety of sauces they offer is also fantastic and adds a unique touch.

The staff is super friendly and even offered us a sample before we made our decision to order, which was a nice bonus.

The portions are generous, and everything is 100% halal with no pork or alcohol, which is a huge plus.

The only downside is the limited seating, but it didn’t bother us much. On our first visit, we got lucky with a seat, but this time we enjoyed our meal in the car.

I can’t wait to return! I ordered from Dr. Shawarma in Birmingham and was thoroughly impressed. The delivery was prompt, and as soon as I opened the package, the enticing aroma filled my home. The first bite was delightful, and the accompanying salad, rice, and mixed shawarma meat were exceptional. I highly recommend their shawarma trays, which come with fries or rice, a can of drink, hummus, and creamy garlic sauce.

Keep up the hard work !
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ What a great late night food venue! The service is always top notch and the shawarma is never dry, no matter the time! Asked for a pot of hummus which they added on at no extra charge.

There looks to be some fantastic, left-field bar snacks available if you’re here primarily to drink.  Friendly, informative and efficient bar staff on hand surely have contributed to this pub being to the 2025 Good Beer Guide. Fantastic roast on the sun trap roof terrace. Cocktails 241 on Sundays and they're really good too. Great service as always and really reasonably priced for the quality. Popped in for a couple of pints, there was a nice selection of beers and a very impressive selection of soft drinks on draught. Barman was sound, friendly service. Can't comment on the food as I didn't eat here.

Was told of the happy hour with 2 for 1 on cocktails but as I was with my kid, I declined it this time! Sat on the rooftop terrace which was a lovely setting to have a drink in.

This was the first pub I ever had a drink in, back in 1997. It's definitely changed a lot for the better since then, a reflection of how the surrounding area has also become something different to back then. What a meal! Simply stunning food. The Church should be sold out every day such is the quality of the food here, I can't believe it wasn't busier. Everything we had was superb, but the beef Sunday roast was one of the best I've had in a restaurant in a long time. We were very greedy and shared three starters too, which were all delicious but probably a bit too much food in total for just the two of us. Nevermind, nothing went to waste!

My only criticism was the toasted sourdough was a bit crispy, and I'd have loved the scotch egg to have a runny yolk. But these are minor points in an otherwise perfect meal with faultless service from the great staff. The overall experience was satisfying enough. The scotch egg crumb could do with reviewing… first time up on the impressive terrace, looking forward to seeing how this experience can be improved in the future. The two of us agreed the harissa needed punching up quite a notch, otherwise inoffensively nice- but not quite the showstopper as it appears on the menu. I guess it would generally appeal to a wider audience. A bit of a wait, but enjoying passing the time at a leisurely rate. We had qr code issues, not the best time when hungry & thirsty.

Of course, it depends on what you’re looking for, but we personally didn’t enjoy our visit.

The service felt very intense, almost like the staff were looking down on us. I get that they have a certain etiquette, but true professionalism means adapting to each customer’s mood and experience – not making them feel uncomfortable. The food itself wasn’t bad, but for a Michelin-rated place, it didn’t blow us away.

We went with a Groupon voucher gifted to us, and were surprised when the bill included a hefty service charge of the full price menu, instead of just charging on top of drinks. I understand that some fine-dining places automatically include service, and normally I’m happy to pay it – if the service matches. But what if it’s young students or guests who received it as a gift and weren’t expecting to be hit with an extra £40–£50? Definitely something worth considering.

What bothered me most was that while filming parts of the experience (which is common in fine dining these days), the waiter told me not to film him as he presented the food. I wasn’t filming him directly – just capturing the overall experience. If you’re working in a high-end, presentation-focused restaurant, you should expect that some guests will be recording. If that’s an issue, maybe a different work environment would suit better.

Overall, the food was decent but not unforgettable, and you can absolutely find better Michelin-level restaurants where the service is warm, respectful, and genuinely customer-focused. Sadly, this one didn’t live up to expectations. A true gem in the dining world! A place I have had the privilege of experiencing multiple times and each time improving on perfection! Talking on my last visit I must say this is a epicentre in not only the midlands but also the UK that all food and wine lovers must attend. We enjoyed the Chefs Table along with Wine pairings and it truly was an amazing experience.
Every piece of food so thoughtfully made within eyesight and explained by the accompanying chef. Wonderfully enjoyed beyond words, needs to be eaten to believe.
Each course served with a perfectly matched wine from the truly knowledgeable Sommelier with a knowledge base far reaching every question asked!
The kitchen staff themselves being an amazing team working together in a fluid atmosphere with the real life day to day, and the amazing teamwork to create the most amazing food all under the eye of Chef Adam. A true great. Fantastic dining experience in the heart of Birmingham on the fly, PJ and his team were excellent hosts and very gracious for the experience. I would highly recommend anyone coming to Birmingham to sample the delightful menu and experience. Stand out dishes include the sweetbread with a beautiful lovage sauce and crunchy almond.

The 50 year old port is a must for anyone, one for the bucket list and the Spanish sommelier is a lovely guy who clearly has a passion for his role and it shines through.

A lot more to say however all positive and will be back again Very nice 7 course taster menu. Pigeon was fantastic!
Service very polite and professional.
Everything was very nice its just that everything was short of exceptional which is what we were expecting. We came to Adams for my birthday with my husband and four year old daughter. We last came here for our 2nd wedding anniversary many years ago. The food and service was just incredible! I am so so pleased that Adams is so family friendly. The staff made a fuss of our daughter and she absolutely loved her experience there. It can be hard to find fine dining places that are so welcoming to children.

However, today, I left this place extremely disappointed. Here’s why:
1.	Atmosphere and Ambiance:
As soon as we entered, there was an overwhelming stuffy smell; the kitchen odors hit you right in the face. Everything looked very messy, disorganized, and worn out.
2.	Cleanliness:
There were dirty used forks and napkins on the floor, and the staff were stepping over them as they walked by. The tables were sticky with grease and sauce stains from previous customers and had not been cleaned properly.
3.	Taste:
Both my meal and my spouse’s meal were served cold. The salads inside had no oil, no salt, and no dressing. The fries were also cold. We were both honestly shocked.
4.	Restrooms:
I was very surprised to see that the male and female restrooms were right next to each other without any separation. This is a basic expectation considering the general clientele of a halal restaurant. In fact, even many British restaurants ensure this comfort with separate entrances for men and women. I was very surprised and disappointed. Moreover, the restrooms were extremely dirty.
5.	Music:
There was very loud pub-style music with heavy bass playing. It was extremely overwhelming. Of course, music could be adjusted easily, but their choice of music shows how disconnected they are from the spirit of this business.

I truly did not want to write a negative review, but I felt I had to, with much regret and disappointment. I sincerely hope this feedback is taken seriously and improvements are made because German Döner is a brand — and this branch does not reflect the brand’s reputation at all. I am sorry to say this. Not quite happy really. I had meat kebab which was crystal cold.

Environment and is not clean and tidy. Staff jumping over forks on the floor. Toilets smelling bad.

Chips was warm but not well mixed with spice.

I need GDK to be good because its an halal franchise that we’ve been in most cities.

I’ve been recently in Edinburgh branch. It was really good from all perspective. You guys have a lot to learn from Edinburgh branch. Sorry but I’ll need GDK to be good. Grabbed the Doner in pitta 🥙 food was decent however doner to salad ratio wasn’t good unfortunately it was near to 70% salad. Donner itself was cooked throughout. This is the best Donner kebab you can find in Birmingham City Center. I tried their chicken and lamb Donner kebabs. I found the chicken Donner  tastes so much better than lamb. However I like the lamb Donner more. I rate their chicken Donner 10/10 and lamb Donner 6/10. The staff is very friendly and nice. The service is quick. I am really impressed with the quality and taste of food. It's up to standard. Kebab bread is fantastic and very similar to a traditional Turkish. Food is bit expensive. But it's worth it.
There is far too much waste which needs to be addressed. Every food item is at least two layers of packaging deep.
Overall I would recommend that it's worth trying at least once.",0.8,0.2,"[""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Mediterranean""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Dietary Options"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

Escalators up but, there is a lift too just not so easy to see, as I had suitcases, that’s for me.
Lovely pleasant staff, found my seat next to the glass railing with a commanding view of the bull. Picked from a good menu, tasted great, plenty of it, well presented. Coffee was good too. And you aren’t stuck in a shop, the people watching is great! I didn’t know the bill performs on the hour!!
A very pleasant hour, thoroughly recommend. We had a wonderful Afternoon Tea at Café Concerto. The service was at a high standard, being well looked after by Giuseppe and the team who kept our tea topped up and their hospitality friendly and informative.

The food was flavoursome, the egg mayo sandwich a must-have! The spread was colourful and well presented, offering a wide variety of textures and fillings. The scones were soft, and the little patisseries were delightful. The tea selection is great, and you have unlimited refills.

Being inside Grand Central, it's easily accessible and has a relaxing atmosphere, natural light all around with comfortable seating. Would highly recommend for friends and couples alike! I stopped by Café Concerto while passing through New Street Station. The café itself was fine – decent coffee and a light bite, though I did find it a bit on the expensive side for what it was.

That said, the atmosphere was lively and the standout was definitely the moving bull statue nearby – such a cool surprise to see that in a train station! It added a really fun vibe to the visit.

Overall, not a bad place for a quick stop if you're in transit, but be prepared to pay a little extra for the convenience and surroundings. Georgeta was amazing, she really was a credit to your company, having been in retail for over 30+ years it's so lovely to see somebody friendly and professional in her role Cafe Concerto is a self-service café where you order at the front before finding a table to enjoy your meal.

We ordered three drinks: the Super Berry Smoothie, Passion Fruit Iced Tea, and Passion Storm Smoothie. The Super Berry Smoothie was sweet and refreshing, just as you’d expect from a classic berry blend. The Passion Storm Smoothie had a strong pineapple flavor with a subtle hint of mango, making it a tropical and enjoyable drink. The Passion Fruit Iced Tea was light and refreshing.

The café was quite busy, yet the staff remained incredibly accommodating and kind despite the high-pressure environment. Their efficiency and friendliness made the experience even better.

I’d love to come back and try some of their sweet or savory dishes next time!",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Mediterranean"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size""]"
ChIJsRXghou8cEgRGrn5-ck4Ufs,Premier Inn Birmingham City Centre (New St Station) hotel,"Exchange Buildings, Stephenson Pl, Birmingham B2 4NH, UK",4.3,0.925,5,5,0,0,N/A,"Rooms were very well ready for my use, everything was put in place just the way I would want it on arrival, clean and tidy. The Premier Plus rooms had everything I needed: kettle, mini-fridge, water bottles, showering equipment etc.
Very convenient location: shops, public transport links, and other conveniences within walking distance and was seemingly safe in terms of security.
Great value for money.
Although staff were very friendly, helpful and assisting when they were there, there were many occasions when there was absolutely nobody at the front desk, so waiting for someone to be able to assist you at all was often a matter of waiting 10 minutes (approx), so I would suggest having 2 people at the front desk for each shift always, so even if 1 is gone away, the other will still be there. I would also suggest having in-room telephones.
The only other slightly disappointing factor was if we are staying more than 1 night, housekeeping is not done in the room unless requested before 12pm, which I didn’t realise until after that, and I wished the cups and mugs were changed and stock on water bottles and chocolate were replenished.
Overall, I do recommend this hotel since it meets 80-90% of average expectations, just those few little factors need working on: staff presence, telephone and housekeeping. Our stay at this hotel was excellent.  The location is perfect for train travellers.  It is right off of New Street, with lots of restaurants, cafes and shops. Easy walking distance to Gas Station Basin, Jewelry Quarter, Bullring, etc. Crowded, high-energy area, but safe and quiet inside the hotel. Our room was larger than expected and very clean and comfortable.  Front desk staff were very helpful overall, though some seemed happier about it than others.  Continental breakfast was good and presented in a very pleasant area.  I would definitely stay here again. Amazing stay! In a busy city it's hard to find a quiet hotel, but this really was. The team were lovey, especially Emma! Couldn't do enough for me including storing and looking after bags and setting me up with a place to work. Highly recommend I had one of the newly refurbished Evolution style rooms on the 6th floor. My room was comfortable, clean, and quiet. The air conditioning was excellent and I didn’t hear much noise from adjacent rooms or the corridor outside. The hotel was ideally located for New Street station. I’d definitely stay here again. First time staying here - for a trip to the Symphony Hall.
As always at a Premier Inn the rooms were clean and the staff were lovely.
We didn't eat here, but sometimes we do the meal deal which is excellent value.
Room was very quiet and we slept well.

Went in on a Sunday afternoon, it was very quiet. Saw a huge espresso machine at the bar but was told no hot drinks were available, so I got the Mrs a cold soft drink.

My first choice of beer, I was told was off, so I settled for another which was decent enough. Didn't see anyone else come in while we had our drinks, after which we left.

I returned to use the toilet a couple of hours after initially leaving. I was walking past to go home, so seemed an easy option. The place was still completely quiet, and the toilet was in a bit of a state, but desperate times. Without a doubt, the worst fish & chips ive ever eaten in a pub/restaurant. At time of writing Cod & Chips (as it was advertised) was £15.95.
From the moment it was served i was immediately deflated by the mere size of the ‘fish’. It was tiny.
I pulled apart the portion. I don’t think there was 2-3 oz of actual fish. This was cod apparently. However the meagre amount that was there was an odd shade of grey where cod is a white fish.
I have no idea what that green stuff was accompanying the fish. It certainly wasn’t mushy peas. A grainy paste like reconstituted portion of garbage with literally no flavour. The chips were as you would expect - catering level.
On the positive though: I had a couple of pints of Landlord Ale which was very nice.

It has limited seating and can get very busy, but is very convenient due to the long opening hours, and the staff are polite, helpful and friendly. In particular, a gentleman named Graham is brilliant - besides being friendly and efficient, he takes pains to remember your name and will often greet you by your name even after months of not having visited! It makes you feel very welcome. Thanks Graham and all the staff at this branch for your hard work! :-) worst coffee ever… After telling this to them they prepared the coffee again (2 times). It was still horrible. They probably didn’t do the maintenance of their coffee machines. Or there was something wrong with the milk. Additionally, one of the workers was extremely rude and she got unnecessaryly defensive, when I just told her there is something wrong with the taste. Just got this hot chocolate now and the staff didn’t say my name when it was ready, had to go ask them and they gave me the worst attitude. I’m sorry but it was so rude I’ve been a loyal Starbucks customer for years, even when others decided to boycott the brand. Unfortunately, my recent experiences at the Birmingham New Street branch have left me quite disappointed due to the behavior of one of the employees, Afyia.

On multiple occasions, I’ve noticed that she rarely smiles or makes an effort to be welcoming. It often feels like customers are not valued when she’s around. Today was the tipping point. She came outside to collect chairs and tables, but instead of politely asking customers to move, she raised her voice and demanded, “Excuse me, we’re going to take the chairs inside now!” The tone was aggressive and commanding, which made me and others feel extremely uncomfortable.

What bothered me most was that there were plenty of other chairs available that could have been taken first, but she felt the need to target a few customers and rush them in such an impolite way. There was no reason for this kind of behavior. Basic courtesy goes a long way, and it’s disheartening to see this lack of professionalism, especially at a place like Starbucks where customer service should be a priority.

Great coffee is available everywhere these days, but customer service is what sets businesses apart. I hope Starbucks addresses this issue at the Birmingham New Street branch, as it’s not the experience I expect from a brand I’ve been loyal to for years. a small branch at the train station.

Absolutley useless location. The drinks are never ready and you have to stand there watching the staff constantly walk past the empty open take away bag because no one can be bothered to fulfill the order.

I wrote this review next to my bike after walking out and I can still see the empty bag just sitting there. The store has zero waiting customers and they're still ignoring the order. I stepped into Starbucks and immediately, the atmosphere felt like a warm embrace. The staff, wearing smiles as their uniform, made me feel like a cherished guest. From the very moment I walked in, I knew this was going to be a delightful experience.

Let me tell you about the Almond Croissant – a heavenly creation with a flaky crust that seemed to melt in my mouth. The almond cream filling was like a secret treasure, rich and velvety. This wasn't just a pastry; it was a work of art, carefully crafted to perfection.

But the surprises didn't stop there. The Banana Caramel Muffin was a symphony of flavors – sweet banana dancing with luscious caramel. And that topping? It wasn't just a topping; it was like a delicious crown, adding a crunch that was incredibly satisfying. Believe me, this treat is a journey you won't want to miss.

Then, there was the Blueberry Muffin – a burst of tangy and sweet berries in every bite. The sugar-crusted top was like a sweet secret waiting to be discovered with every mouthful. I couldn't help but close my eyes and savor the blissful moment.

The pain au Chocolat was a rendezvous with sophistication. With each bite, it was like I was transported to a charming French café. The fusion of flavors was like a dance of elegance and comfort in my mouth.

And let's not forget the Chocolate Twist – it was like a playful game of hide and seek with chocolate surprises. Every twist revealed a burst of cocoa goodness, and it was perfect for anyone with a love affair with chocolate.

So, here's my advice: plan a visit to Starbucks, indulge in these delightful creations, and then come back to thank me for introducing you to this world of taste and wonder. Your taste buds will thank you! A very clean and well lit Starbucks with one floor of seating, including chairs and sofas. Music was a bit loud so it was a little hard to concentrate on my book!

Accessible bathroom available. Slow service but this store was maybe understaffed. A nice location and easy to find. Not too busy during the week and could be my new go to Starbucks. Favourite branch in the city, cosy & not too busy!

Staff are brilliant & welcoming too! Convenient location, seating is around the edges against the walls. You don't need a code for the toilet, which is a bonus. Drinks were made hot and quickly.

Good atmosphere and the food was good too. I had the battered mushrooms (would recommend) to start and sea bass, chips and peas for the main. Meal was hot and came within 10 mins (start and the main course). A good pub with great food and prices. (would recommend). I don’t usually write reviews, but the service we received from Carl absolutely deserves recognition. From the moment we were seated, Carl made us feel welcomed and at ease. His warm, genuine attitude stood out immediately — attentive without being overbearing, and always one step ahead of our needs.

He knew the menu inside out and gave great recommendations that turned out to be spot-on. What really impressed us was his timing and attention to detail — drinks were refilled before we had to ask, and the courses arrived at a perfect pace. Even when the restaurant got busy, Carl remained calm, friendly, and completely professional.

It’s rare to find someone who clearly takes pride in their work like Carl does. He helped make the night feel more special, and we’ll definitely be coming back — largely because of the excellent experience he provided.

Highly recommend asking for Carl if you’re dining here. A true credit to the team. Found this place as a friend and I were looking for somewhere to meet for an overdue catchup
Food was awful, burnt and had no flavour whatsoever the dish was hot but the inside of the lasagna was cold

service was rubbish the man behind the bar with the glasses was so rude when taking my order.
We were eating at a table which had a sign saying reserved from 7pm we sat there as it was around 5.30pm he came over and changed it to 6.30 to rush us out
Never again I was blown away at the quality and value for money that the country girl provided. I ordered a rump steak which was accompanied by a grilled mushroom, grilled tomato, crispy onion strips, peas and chunky chips. All were top notch and I even took them up on their special offer of another 8oz rump steak for only another £5 which I've never seen at any establishment before. I recommend the county girl to anyone looking for a pleasant, family friendly English pub which offers friendly service from the staff. 5/5 stars 🌟 Met up with friends for Sunday lunch here. One of the reasons we chose this place was that it welcomes dogs, which our friends were bringing. Good range of food including kids menu and veggie options. I went for the veggie burger that came with chips, which I enhanced by borrowing some gravy that came with my husband's meal! Adults and kids all enjoyed their meals.

Some staff follow the standards for making matcha latte, while others don’t care unfortunately I had a really disappointing experience at this Starbucks. I understand that I had taken up excessive seating, but when I first sat down, the place was nearly empty. Instead of politely asking me to move or adjust my setup as it was starting to get busy, an employee (who I think may be the manager) told me along the lines of, “If you’re not buying another drink, you’ll have to leave.” This felt especially unfair because I had already purchased two items (a vanilla iced latte and a white chocolate and pistachio cake) and was thinking to purchase another drink but just not at that specific moment that she had asked. To make matters worse, I saw someone who hadn’t bought anything sitting there for two hours without being asked to leave. I get that stores can enforce seating policies, but the way I was singled out made the experience feel unwelcoming and frustrating. Also, I had helped this specific employee a few days prior after she knocked down a few crisps packets and picked them up for her. I didn’t have to do that but out of kindness I did, but this is how she treats me instead.

Service is friendly and welcoming, if you get a seat by the large front windows in day time, there's a lovely view of the cathedral and it's grounds to take in. After seeing The Old Joint Stock Pub & Theatre on social media we just had to visit.

As soon as you walk through the door, the decor and huge glass dome above takes your breath away. The decor is very opulent.

We dined on the upper floor.
The food was very well presented and the pie for two to share was super tasty.
One of us has dairy allergy and the staff were very attentive and pointed out various dishes which had certain dairy requirements.
I would give more stars if I could.
All round, our visit was perfect in every way.
A big thank you to all staff and I can guarantee that we will return 😀 Visited here with a group of friends to attend the ‘do you hear the people sing’ karaoke performance! We found this event of social media and it was a fabulous night! Totally recommend to keep an eye out on the events they have on! Venue was absoutely stunning, definitely a hidden gem Probably the best Fuller’s pub I’ve been to. The selection on tap is mostly the same as you’d expect, but The Old Joint Stock Pub stands out for a few reasons: The bar staff were really friendly and welcoming, which is always a pleasant surprise for Londoners visiting other cities in the UK—and definitely appreciated. The food was also great.. Classic pub food done well and with an interesting twist - we had the macaroni bites, chicken and roast potatoes with marmite, plus a cub sandwich, washed down with Frontier and Guinness. The pies looked great too. Despite being a city centre pub, it had a relaxed vibe with excellent service bringing the food to the table, cutlery, etc. It’s clear they take service seriously. Another unique aspect of the pub is the theatre upstairs, which adds to the uniqueness. Even though it’s owned by a brewery chain, it has its own distinctive style. The decor is well thought out, with a lovely connection to its history, and there are no TVs or other elements that can ruin classic pub old interiors.The other customers were a mix of colleagues after work, dates, and small groups of people— all respectful. There was a nice buzz about the place, but it wasn’t hectic or frustrating to get served. We stayed for about an hour and a half and had a great time. Such an amazing decoration and interior, first time to visit this bar, we arrived late and only had half an hour for a drink and chat, but I was astonished by the beauty of the place, you should check their website site for their events.

We traveled all the way from London to Birmingham for an extraordinary buffet experience that truly exceeded expectations. With hundreds of dishes from every corner of the globe, this is a food lover’s paradise! Whether you’re craving Italian, Malaysian, Mexican, Chinese, or Indian cuisine, there’s something here for everyone.

We couldn’t resist ending the meal on a sweet note with the chocolate fountain, marshmallows, and an array of desserts. It’s the perfect finale to an unforgettable feast!🥳

If you’re looking for your next foodie destination, this is it. This was our first day Birmingham so we decided to try out the local restaurants. This was a great experience. Nydile was very accommodating and explained in detail how the service operates. The selection was a bit more limited than I am I used to but I there was still a variety of foods to try. We dined on Friday and they had a 2 for 1 special on drinks. Very nice.

This fish here was amazing. Very tender and well seasoned. I would pair it with the chicken birani

My only negative was the children that were noisy and treating the atmosphere like their personal playground. Despite the employees’ efforts to kindly ask them to behave, the parents were simply allowing g them to do as they please. I think to support staff and other diners, there should be a policy around noise and general disruptive behaviours. Jimmy Spices in Birmingham offers a fantastic Indian dining experience with a great selection of dishes. I thoroughly enjoyed the Indian food and desserts—the flavors were rich, the spices were well-balanced, and everything was fresh and delicious.

A special shoutout to Nydile for their amazing hospitality! Their warm and attentive service made the experience even better. Highly recommend for anyone craving quality Indian food with great service! For a diverse and delightful dining experience in Birmingham, look no further than Jimmy Spice's Global Buffet.

I do believe that a clean khazi is a big plus when I'm out and about. I'm a cistern addict. Called in for a quick beer, a large pub, typical Wetherspoons. Toilets upstairs, unable to use as they had some sort of flooding problem, water started to come through the ceiling in the bar area, so I decided to leave.

Emma in the Squirrel was my complete favourite because I always felt she loved my daughter as though she were her own and as such they had a fantastic bond. That kind of care made it so easy for me to go to work every day.

Whenever I dealt with the nursery managers regarding admin issues, they were responsive, reasonable and accomodating.

I definitely recommend Elms nursery. My daughter is thriving. Its hard to completely trust others with your child but I look forward to her nursery days as much as her.

I bought a fruit smoothie as I saw it on the board outside, they also do veggie ones but I only saw that after I already ordered 😆.

Also attached to a rotating art gallery and has a cafe with tasty, well made coffee. Friendly staff! And generally a nice place to rest. Seems to wheelchair accessible which is awesome. Including a disabled toilet seemingly accessible for wheelchair uses! great selection of vintage finds including an impressive collection of vinyls, cds and cassettes. the food is incredible and grateful for the friendly service the man at the till offered. thank you! Lostalgia is a cool spot. Great coffee, a cozy vibe, and so many unique vintage finds. But honestly, Libby and Merissa are what make it special.

There was only one staff and she was clearly overwhelmed between all orders coming in. The coffee dark sugar bubble tea I had was very milky, the strawberry matcha had nothing matcha but all sugar and the matcha bubble tea was not the tastier. For the price, there are way better options. Wouldn’t recommend. I tried the classic milk tea and I have to say that I was left quite disappointed, nth special first and last time trying it.The only upside would be the very affordable price. I got the Oreo frosted milk with brown sugar tapioca, large, for £6.25. It was nice but a bit expensive compared to similar I’ve had elsewhere in Birmingham. Had a lovely dairy-free Taro bubble tea during hot day. The decor was also quite pretty that I had to take pictures. The drinks were very watered down.

The server was very nice but there was only one person taking orders and making the drinks which made it slow, especially since it’s a busy area. This would have been fine if the drinks were nice but they were not.

I love bubble tea and seeing as it was my first time trying this place I went for the usually safe order of a brown sugar milk tea. However it was so watered down. I’ve had bubble teas before that just tasted like milk but this wasn’t even milk, it was watery milk.

And the whole point of a brown sugar is the syrup, which I chose after looking at the poster picture displaying the drink with  having lots of syrup all along the inside of the cup. In reality I couldn’t even see any syrup. I know pictures can exaggerate a bit but this was just false advertising. It was just brown watery milk with no syrup and the tapiocas were sticking together as well.

Also two of the drinks I asked for warm, as the sign specifically showed they offer both hot and cold, but what I received was just room temperature. I was disappointed.

Maybe their other products are fine but I would not recommend getting a milk tea from there, and if you do go expect there might be a wait.",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"
ChIJu9M2fe68cEgRyGko8VuGmaM,Semedos restaurant,"54 Warstone Ln, Birmingham B18 6NG, UK",4.1,0.96024,5,5,0,0,N/A,"Semedos restaurant has become a regular visit for me when in the jewelry quarter. With good food at a competitive price, semedos offers the option to dine in and enjoy a comfortable meal.
All the food we have had from the restaurant has been brilliantly flavored and well presented, I must recommend the lunch time menu for a bargain meal.
The service is basic as they have a smaller number of staff working, but no more should be expected especially at the good price they are offering. The restaurant is often unfortunately quite, this should not deter and instead should be described as a hidden gem.
Other than the lunch time menu I have not sampled any of the wider menu, however the deserts do look amazing, but the wider main menu can rise more to the expensive side.
If I had to offer any improvements to the restaurant I would recommend attempting to raise the atmosphere by ensuring the staff are friendly and outgoing.
Definitely try this one out for yourself. I must admit, our experience here was truly exceptional from beginning to end. The cuisine was outstanding, and Stevan provided us with impeccable service. Additionally, in honor of Ramadan, they graciously offered us complimentary dates and watermelon for breakfast. (2023/10/05)
Another visit this Thursday at 4pm, another inefficient service. While there were only 5 customers including myself at the time, I waited exactly 20 minutes for my Chicken Mushroom Stroganoff and Peri Peri Burger. I wouldn't say they were lack of staff, they were just used to a below par service speed.

My Peri Peri Burger was again very dry this time, really hard to finish it without a drink. My Chicken Mushroom Stroganoff was not cooked in an Italian way, you could see from the photo that pasta, chicken and sauce were definitely cooked separately. Not looked very nice, but the actual taste was okay. The pasta was in a proper state, neither raw nor mush. The sauce was creamy with a Peri Peri mix, it went well with the pasta. However the chicken had a totally different taste, didn't have a harmony with the rest of the dish. At least, it reached my expectation for a £12.05 pasta dish.

I'm gradually losing my love with Semedos, the food quality is maybe not that high. Semedos will still be one of my options in Jewellery Quarter, though the order has definitely changed.

(2023/08/17)
Another visit this Thursday at 5pm, still an off-peak period with only a few customers but the service was inefficient this time. It took me around 27 minutes to get everything I ordered (1/4 Peri Peri Chicken with Fries, 3pc Lamb Chops and 3pc Baklava).

Disappointingly, the chicken I got this time was too dry. Bigger portion of dry chicken just imagine, pack of protein! Nutritious but not delicious. The Lamb Chops and Baklava were both fine. That’s it, nothing more nothing less.

Some comments are saying that they waited more than an hour to get their dishes. If you order something big in a busy period, one hour is definitely possible and nothing is exaggerated.

Found this restaurant online and it had some decent reviews. First visit this Friday at 5pm, definitely an off-peak period. Only 1 staff there, but the service was friendly and efficient.

There was a huge menu with very competitive prices in Jewellery Quarter. The impression climaxed when I saw the 2 plates. Well, they looked so good with such prices. Maybe the expectation was too high, the actual tastes could not match in the end.

The best item for me was the Peri Peri Chicken, really tender and juicy. The Peri Peri Burger was okay apart from the patty that was relatively dry. Fries and Chunky Chips were freshly fried and they tasted delicious with salt and all those condiments provided. The Gelato was a huge disappointment. Very icy, 1 of the scoops wasn't even compact! Maybe I should have checked the display counter more carefully before I placed the order. The Nata tasted a bit weird, not sure whether that was the authentic Portuguese taste.

Overall, still a fairly positive experience. Will come back for sure, still want to check out some other items on their menu. One of the best meal ever
It was cooked by women chief
And the owner was a lady as well

Only one security guy ruined the end of the night for us for shouting  at my boyfriends face “ because he is too tired” and he got a reaction.

Shouldn’t be shouting at clients that were enjoying the whole night without causing trouble , just because you had a long day at work.

I work as a bartender in a very busy nightclub and I have never shouted at one last costumer  ( especially knowing they been having  drinks) for wanting more drinks even when we’re closing down , I stay calm and still politely tell them it’s closed , I don’t start shouting “GO HOME” at them because I had a long shift.

Hopefully he works on that so clients don’t react that way anymore. Rest of the security were helpful and respectful to my boyfriend.

So overall was a very good night but the end bit. We were prevented from entering because we were simply wearing a bag, which was designer and that cost me a lot. The security guard at the entrance said that men cannot enter with bags. And the security guard was very ignorant. It was very homophobic. Horrible this.

Decent portion sizes, the fish and chips were piping hot when I got home (hence the short wait at the shop). Perhaps I came at the right time, or there has been a change in ownership recently? I’m not affiliated btw. Captain John's Fish & Chip Shop offers an average dining experience that leaves much to be desired.
The seating area, with its dirty tables and worn out bar stools which look like they’ve never been cleaned,
are poorly maintained and uninviting.

Service is functional but lacks warmth, making the overall experience feel quite unfriendly.
As for the food, it disappoints despite its appealing appearance. My friend had the fish and chips, as he avoids halal meat, but found the dish quite bland.
I opted for just the chips, which were basic and flavorless.

In summary, Captain John's is a passable option if you're only choice, but better alternatives are likely available for a more satisfying fish and chips meal. Don't know what's happened but this place has gone down hill. Apparently this is a large meal but barley a handful of chips. I wondered why she went behind the prep area to wrap it. Also be careful of allergies as I ordered just donner kebab but the woman put the chicken on it whichever is based in something. When I pointed this out she just took the chicken off and put it BACK into the chicken pot with all the rest of the chicken.

I recently had a total knee replacement at The Priory Hospital in Birmingham, performed by Mr. Marcus Green. From the moment I arrived, I was treated with the utmost care and professionalism. The nursing team were exceptional—kind, attentive, and always ready to help with a smile.

The hospital itself was immaculate, with the highest standards of cleanliness I’ve ever seen in a medical setting. To top it off, the food was excellent—fresh, tasty, and well-prepared.

I’m incredibly grateful for the care I received and want to thank Mr. Green and the entire team for making what could have been a daunting experience so smooth and reassuring. I highly recommend The Priory Hospital to anyone in need of first-class medical treatment. I had a very positive experience with the outpatient services at The Priory. The staff were welcoming and professional, and I felt well cared for throughout. I was referred for an ultrasound scan, which was arranged quickly and handled with great care and efficiency. The whole process felt smooth and reassuring. Highly recommend their outpatient care. Really lovely setting and kind, pleasant staff. Came here to get private treatment for an ankle problem and it was a really great experience from start to finish. Lots of free parking, lovely leafy setting, never waiting long for appointment and quick responses to invoice and appointment queries. Thank you, would definitely recommend. As a whole, The Priory Hospital staff are exceptionally caring, polite and professional staff.  They supported me throughout my time at the hospital - for a full knee replacement - and are still supporting me after I've been discharged when needed too!

All the staff in the Dudley Ward were wonderful, but some notable mentions are below:
Dr Khalid Baloch - My consultant and surgeon.  He is highly skilled, knowledgeable and very compassionate too!
Mary, Tom and Kim - My wonderful physiotherapists who answered a plethora of questions from my family and I!
Samah and Shameela - The world's best Healthcare Assistants!
Hope and Prerana - My amazing Nurses!
Michelle, Sam, Laura and Mary - The lovely Catering Team
Sam - The lovely soul who assisted me to Theatre and reassured me constantly!
Damien - The amazing Porter who helped my family on the day of my discharge from the hospital. All the staff I encountered were lovely - I felt like a person and not just another number. All the nurses on the ward looked after me so well and nothing felt like too much trouble. It was an especially difficult thing for me to do as I've had some unpleasant experiences with medical health professionals in the past.

Was a nice restaurant that served nice food, has it was a nice hot day we sat on the terrace enjoying the views.  Plus I can’t believe this was 20 minutes away from where we live.
If you get the chance go and pay a visit.  😊 Had a lovely day here. The house is beautifully presented and thoroughly interesting. The gardens were some of the best I've seen, and were bigger than they looked online. My mum managed well on her mobility scooter  outside, and inside there is a lift for access to all floors. Definitely would recommend! Just one of my favourite gardens. It is varied in different areas and then varies beautifully through the seasons. The wisteria walk in late spring is fabulous, the herbaceous borders in summer and then the autumn colours later in the year are all beautiful. A reasonable cafe though it would be better if the kitchen was made proper use of rather than all pre prepared food. Lovely historical house, but the real jewel is the extensive gardens. I went on a lovely sunny day and everything was in bloom! There is a variety of different garden styles, and I recommend you visit all of them. I particularly enjoyed the woodland walk - not what I expected. There was a wooden walkway over water with gigantic lilies - just spectacular. There is a lovely little tea shop that sells cakes and some savoury options. I had the soup of the day. This was my first full day in Birmingham, and while it wasn't the sunniest day, it was lovely. I recommend purchasing an entrance ticket to save time.

Everybody was so friendly and helpful from reception staff , dental nurses and the dentist herself was lovely. I didn’t feel  rushed and she was very thorough in her examination of my teeth and gums giving me options regarding what needs to be done .
She also took the time to have a little chat with me about my work and what my day had in store .
Whilst I was waiting in the waiting room a lovely older lady came in and when the dental nurse called her to go to see the dentist she was just so nice with her , greeted her with a lovely smile and to maintain eye contact with the lady the nurse walked backwards and confined her conversation and then as the lady was not great on her feet she offered to take her bag and she walked behind her up the stairs .
To sum up it was just so nice to see everybody  greeted with a smile , and just being friendly and nice and also very professional,
which can be rare these days . Excellent customer service and dental patient care. I have been attending for many years and have had a multitude of treatments. Each visit is always a pleasant experience and they always deliver the best person-centered care approach. The staff are all so lovely, welcoming and professional at all times. I want to say a massive thank you to the full team and especially to Dr Alisha Ubhoo & Dental Assistant Sasha. Brilliant service from start to finish. The receptionists were lovely and friendly. The Dentist and his assistant were perfect. They made my children feel so relaxed knowing it was their first time visiting a dentist. There was no judgment at all. My daughters, who were originally very fearful, left the dentist with a smile on their faces and can't wait to visit again I would like to express my deep gratitude for the excellent dental care I have received from Edgbaston Dental Centre. I had mixed experiences with dentists before, so I was nervous when I went to the Centre. I have attended 3 times now, and each time I have received excellent dental treatment. I am very fortunate to have Dr. Jannat Mohammad as my dentist. She was very thorough in examining me and devising a treatment plan. The fillings she has done have relieved me of a lot of discomfort and pain. She has patiently answered all my queries and even called me back to explain things I was not clear about the first time. She is a gentle, compassionate, and excellent dentist. The reception staff (in particular, Azeem and Sharan) are very courteous, helpful and professional. They were very helpful when I requested my dental records from the first consultation. It has been a pleasure to interact with them. All in all, I am very happy with the Dental Centre. Given the variable quality of dentists out there, I feel very fortunate in receiving dental care from the Edgbaston Dental Centre.

Dr. Ashok Patnaik I hadn't visited a dentist in about six or seven years, so I had a lot of plaque build-up and a small case of gum disease. One of the practitioners, Esha, was fantastic. Cleaned everything up and helped get my teeth back to feeling solid. After three visits over the past year, my teeth are holding strong and the sensitivity in my gums is fully gone.

I was a little uncertain given the odd review mentioning service problems with smaller groups. We were a table of 4 . My fears were quickly dispelled by a really good and well organised front of house team. We particularly liked Victoria’s attentive and charismatic charm throughout the evening.

This was our first visit to Bank and we’re delighted with the menu. Really good starters in fact they were exceptional. Fish was tasty and beautifully cooked. We all enjoyed the cocktails and the setting over the canal was lovely.

Personally I do think the meals are good value give the quality of the produce the presentation and location.

We will have to return if we are in the area again but will have to try the other restaurants within the chain when possible.

Thanks to the team for lovely evening. Well done Victoria and thanks for the truffles! If you want to treat yourself (or your loved ones), Bank is a fantastic option. It's on the pricier side, but this is fine dining we're talking about!

We arrived a little early but were able to wait in the bar area until our table was ready. Our friendly server took us to our table and gave us plenty of time to browse the menu before ordering. Everything was incredibly clean and tidy. My partner and I both went for the veal, which was cooked perfectly. For dessert we tried the burnt Basque cheesecake, a favourite of ours and it didn't disappoint!

It was incredibly busy on the Sunday evening we visited, and the wait was around 30 minutes for our food. We thought this was acceptable given how busy they were.

As already mentioned, it's expensive here but well worth it for a special occasion. The bill includes an optional service charge, and speaking to our server we learned it does go to them and not the management and we were happy to pay it - the service really is very good.

You can park at the nearby Q-park or any of the other car parks in the area if you don't mind a short walk. I’ve come here many times before and always have great service - should’ve left reviews for those times so making sure I leave this for my recent visit on Saturday! The friend I was coming with is actually moving back to Australia so I wanted to sit out on the terrace (left a note on the booking) and the lady who greeted us was really helpful, she got us sat at the bar while we waited as it was full (not surprising as the sun was out) and then came to grab us within 10 minutes as she didn’t want us to miss the space - thank you!

Our server on the terrace was Renee, she was a whole vibe! Absolutely loved her, it was honestly like talking to a friend from start to finish. I know that is part of her job, but it wasn’t like being served normally - it was like being out with the girls, but she was still professional of course! We didn’t wait too long for anything, and when one of the drinks did take a little longer she came over and let us know which was nice. Her section was very busy but she still made us feel like a priority! I honestly love people like this - just friendly, funny, and know how to have a laugh! Thank you for making my friends only experience so lovely, and I’ll of course be back soon!

(THE FOOD IS ALWAYS GREAT BTW!) Me and the wife shared the Sunday Sharer Platter which came with two meats (we chose chicken and beef) and it also came with cauliflower cheese & roasted carrots and parsnips. Also included was two sharer deserts and we went with the sticky toffee pudding and raspberry cheesecake. The service was great and staff were always on hand if needed. Family friendly, with a nice atmosphere. For what we got it was a great price and will definitely be coming again! Mothering Sunday family lunch for four today. Positives: lovely seating areas (indoor and outdoor), comfy chairs and benches. Nice views over the canal area. Staff friendly and numerous. Skipped the Mother's Day menu (£45 for 2 courses / £50 for three) and went a la carte. Great choice of dishes and drinks. Grill menu is excellent. Negatives: didn't get one of 3 Korean Chicken starters so 3 of us ate the starter and then 10min later the 4th came over. There should have been a goodwill gesture from the restaurant but there wasn't. We spent £60 a head on average so it's a bit of a miss by the establishment. A discretionary tip of 10% was paid but frankly I didn't think it was deserved.

All the guests said how fabulous the food was. Fresh, tasty, generous portions, with great choice of sauces and extras. They made it all happen, great service, plus a very reasonable way to feed 120 people a delicious meal! So glad we booked them. We highly recommend! Extremely popular venue with a busy lunch rush most days. Decent value for money, not massive burrito but definetly decent sized. Felt like it’s a bit overrated though, the meat was not that flavourful and spicy sauces lacking a decent kick. Was decent but not worth the hype. Mostly takeaway only. Will note service is extremely quick which is good, but wonder if it is affecting quality. I ordered a pulled pork burrito from Habaneros today, and the experience was incredibly disappointing. The cheese had an off taste, which completely ruined the meal. Several colleagues who also ordered agreed that something was not right. For a place that is always busy for lunch, this was unacceptable. Quality control needs serious improvement—I won’t be returning anytime soon. Our office come here a few times a week food is always great,
Our hump day  go to! korean pulled pork 🤌🏿
There is a queue but don't let that put you off-its fast and the food IS worth it!!
Unfortunately this week (Wed) it comes down to a staff/service issue when it gets to the final part of getting the food the sauce and packing bit, the chap is rude & impolite ,which we have come to expect but this week it was next level
(in comparison to the other staff who were great!)
Plus burrito was very poorly wrapped so
most of our office have switched to the rice box and homemade nachos which are definitely worth a try!
Other than that its efficient & delicious , highly recommended

I was early so got to soak in the atmosphere of this charming pub and I wasn't disappointed.
I'd previously been here under the previous owners and wasn't that impressed, but then I noticed it had closed for a bit and has now reopened under new ownership.
I stopped for a pint when passing when it first reopened and knew I'd be back.
Ignore the old reviews as this place deserves to be judged on how it is now.
Good selection of drinks including 3 cask ales, food was really nice and reasonable prices and the staff were awesome.
I'll definitely be returning with more friends next time. Typically, I appreciate the dining experience and ambiance. However, my recent encounter was markedly different. As a resident of Aston University’s campus, I and my companions frequently patronize the establishment for beverages. Today, I ordered my customary “Chicken Tikka Rice”, but to my dismay, the chicken was not cooked. Instead of expressing remorse for the error, the staff responded with rudeness. Such behavior is highly disrespectful and deeply disheartening to a loyal student.
The incident transpired approximately 20:45, when the kitchen was nearing its closing hour. In an attempt to expedite the process, the staff compelled me to place an order promptly. I believe this hastened the cooking mistake. The experience was profoundly disappointing. Absolutely amazing place. Spent the commonwealth games here for food and drinks on a daily basis. So a few of us came back a year later and it did not disappoint. Food is absolute exceptional and great value. Staff are really nice and nothing is to much. Will definitely be back again next year and highly recommend this place. Had a very tasty meal, chicken goujons and a lasagne! With 2 Guiness, it was just over £25! Absolute bargain!

Outstanding Service from Bundala and Mohammed – Highly Recommended!

We are incredibly grateful to Bundala and Mohammed at Davisons Law Edgbaston for their exceptional support during our mortgage purchase. Their professionalism, attention to detail, and constant communication made the entire process smooth and stress-free.

They were always available to answer our questions, explained every step clearly, and ensured that everything was handled efficiently and on time. Their dedication and friendly approach truly made a difference in our home-buying journey.

Thank you both for your outstanding service — we couldn’t have done it without you! We highly recommend Davisons Law to anyone looking for a trustworthy and competent legal team. I am extremely satisfied with the outstanding service provided by Nadia and Nataleigh. Throughout the process, they were professional, responsive, and truly went above and beyond to ensure everything was handled smoothly. Their clear communication, attention to detail, and supportive approach made the experience stress-free and reassuring.

I felt fully supported at every step and was consistently impressed with their efficiency and dedication. It’s rare to find such a reliable and genuinely caring team. I would highly recommend their services without hesitation and believe they are a real credit to their organisation.

Thank you once again, Nadia and Nataleigh, for your excellent service and support! We recently sold our house and were incredibly fortunate to have Lauren guide us. From start to finish, her professionalism, efficiency, and clear communication made a potentially stressful experience much smoother. Every question we had was answered promptly, and she went above and beyond to ensure all legal aspects were handled thoroughly and swiftly.

We felt fully supported throughout, and their attention to detail gave us complete confidence in every step of the sale. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Davisons Law Edgbaston to anyone needing reliable and knowledgeable legal support when buying or selling property.

Thank you again for all your help—it truly made a difference. My husband and I would like to thank Daniel Phipps in Edgbaston Branch for his time and assistance with our purchase. It's greatly appreciated. He handled our application and our experience with him was exceptional, his dedication and commitments are phenomenal, he goes above and beyond, he even works and communicate on the weekends and his devotion and attention are amazing for which we are extremely grateful. Overall we had an excellent experience with Davisons Law.

Wish you all the very best in your future plans. This is my second move in four years and Davisons Law, particularly Bundala Sosovele and Mohammed Riko have by far been the best conveyancing solicitors I have used. Responsive in a timely fashion expert advice and always on hand to deal with any queries. They have managed to ensure my sale and purchase were turned around promptly and efficiently. I would not hesitate to recommend Davisons law for all of your conveyancing needs needs. Outstanding.",1.0,0.0,"[""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience""]"

The staff were really attentive. Especially the gentleman,  I think he was the owner.
Can’t remember his name!!!! Didn’t catch his name!
He was really helpful, kind and informative and he let me taste some of the gelato before I chose them for my sundae, which is not a given in most places.
The presentation of the desserts were impeccable. I really enjoyed it and I will definitely visit back here again..the only thing was that it was really cold in the place but other than that I’ll still come back for sure!
The hot chocolate was so nice too and well presented.
A lot of pride and effort goes into making the desserts for the customers. It’s not rushed. You get your moneys worth for sure! Thanks guys!!! See you again! I found a wowcher deal for afternoon tea for 2. The service was good, and the staff members were attentive. The presentation of the afternoon tea was really cute! I do think it would've been nice if they gave more variety of desserts as the desserts were quite small. They gave 4 different sandwich flavours , all of which i did enjoy. It also came with a hot drink each, the staff just gave us tea, without allowing us to choose. It would've been better if they gave us an option to pick which hot drink we'd like. But overall it was nice, we did enjoy it. We went here today after having a brunch.  Place was lovely and busy.  Even though there were quite a few staff service was a little on the slower side.  Luckily we weren’t in any rush and when we did get to speak to staff, they were amazing.  Really went out their way for our requests. I ordered a milk cake and whilst it was a very nice cake I expected it to be as other milk cakes and drenched in milk so I was a little disappointed that it wasn’t.  Overall a nice experience and I would recommend :) Tucked away in a part of Birmingham I didn’t even know existed, this dessert shop was a great find. The menu had plenty of tempting options, and the seating area was not only spacious but also spotlessly clean. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the service was efficient and friendly. Yummy desserts. A hidden gem worth visiting! It was super cute in here. The waitress that was attending to us was very sweet and very accommodating. The waffle was WELL DONE, not that soggy stuff that some places do. It was crispy and soft.

We started with grilled tiger prawns and salt & pepper squid both were fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The highlight of the starters, though, was the scallops, probably the best I’ve had in Birmingham served with a rich, creamy sauce that complemented them beautifully.

For mains, my wife chose the 3-cheese pizza, which was indulgent and packed with flavor, while I went for the rotisserie chicken in a spicy honey sauce. The chicken was juicy, tender, and had just the right balance of sweetness and heat.

On top of the fantastic food, the service was great, attentive, friendly, and efficient. We had a wonderful time and can’t wait to come back!

5/5 ⭐ Me and mum happened to cross The White Swan and popped in to see if we could get a Sunday dinner. The setting and atmosphere was just wonderful. The food was outstanding. We had driven from Leicester to Birmingham and would happily do the drive again to eat at The White Swan. The staff made you feel so welcome with great service. Highly recommend. Thanks for making our day. We recently visited The White Swan for a Valentines meal. This is the second time we’ve eaten here and we couldn’t recommend the place enough, the Atmosphere is so relaxed yet elegant, the staff are really friendly and attentive and the food was superb.
Special Mention to Debs who has been exceptional on all out visits, friendly, professional and along with the other staff members really made us feel welcome and added to our experience,  Thank you to all the team. We have already booked back in for Mother’s Day and will no doubt be back for a few visits before then.

Ian & Emma I came in during lunch and, short on time for their lunch set, opted for the steak fillet sandwich—and it was lovely. I appreciated being given the option to choose my steak’s temperature, a detail that speaks well of the restaurant’s commitment to quality. I went for medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection. Although a fillet can sometimes be a bit tough, this one was mostly tender and exceptionally juicy. The dish came with a side of skinny fries that were perfectly crispy on the outside and delightfully fluffy on the inside. Complementing the sandwich was a beef dripping sauce—essentially a rich jus—that was simply amazing. Overall, a very good experience. I’d rate it 9/10 and will definitely return. Amazing staff, Sandro was very attentive,  nothing was too much trouble.
Chefs are extremely talented, food flavours complemented each other, the crispy Duck salad kept giving, the warm ginger and carrot slaw, the crunchy noodles and the fresh taste of pineapple ketchup!
Ooo well worth the visit, and to top it off with Toffee Crèmè Brûlée, what a surprise, a smooth rich toffee sauce to greet you when you get to the bottom definitely Delicious! 😋",1.0,0.0,"[""Italian"", ""Chinese"", ""Burger"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Dessert"", ""Seafood""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

Nice and clean with a good vibe. Quick and friendly service. Didn't try the food so can't comment on that.

The cibatta bread was rock hard...none of us were really over whelmed with our food...I suppose you pay your money you take your chances. It was more about getting together after work. Nice vibrant atmosphere, music became louder as the evening went on. Our barman Harry was awesome, very welcoming, accommodating and friendly. Helped and delivered on certain requests set the pubs guests and my daughter totally enjoyed her 30th Birthday. Thanks Harry The Sunday Roasts were outstanding. Plenty of everything. We added a portion of cauliflower cheese each, but one portion between two would have been plenty. The beer was great. The staff were friendly and attentive. No complaints at all. Came in for brunch with my partner. We had originally gone to the wetherspoons next door but there were no free tables and I'm so glad we went next door to Sun On The Hill.

It was moderately busy but we got a table easily and order was taken straight away at the bar. The guy who served me was friendly and served me something off the breakfast menu and my partner something off the lunch menu even tho the lunch menu didn't start for another half an HR, that was very nice of him and it's little things like that that you go away remembering.

I ordered the bigger breakfast and my partner had the CBLT. We were amazed how fast the food came out and even more surprised how good it all tasted. The sausages with the breakfast were really good. And the price was good too.

However the rest rooms are upstairs so prepare yourself to climb a few stairs. This place is not for children or pets.

Overall great experience. I highly recommend for a good Night out experience. Excellent African (mostly Nigerian and south African) music. But the floors were so sticky. It was difficult to dance.

The service was warm and attentive, and the entire space feels thoughtfully designed – from the plush seating to the natural light pouring through the windows. The food and drinks were equally delightful, offering a fresh and flavourful selection that matched the ambience perfectly.

Highly recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth or looking for a perfect coffee break A Hidden Gem for Coffee and Dessert Lovers – Cake and Culture

Spent a lovely afternoon with the wife at this cafe. It was calm and minimalistic, with a clean aesthetic and a really relaxing vibe. I enjoyed a smooth and well-balanced espresso with a beautifully presented black forest slice and there was certainly no complaints from the better half who opted for a strawberry tartlet and latte. Staff were warm, attentive, and made us feel welcome without being overbearing.

Would love to see a V60 pour over on the menu in the future — it would be a perfect fit for the space and give filter coffee fans a reason to linger. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys thoughtful coffee and a peaceful atmosphere. I had a lovely visit to Cake & Culture with our group of friends on their opening day. Super busy coffee shop, the coffee was really beautiful, I really love when I get a good cup of coffee! Their croissants are so beautiful and fluffy, and the little pyramid cake was so yummy! I also tried the goat cheese and fig pastry which I highly recommend, it was such a nice mix of sweet and savoury. Before I left, I treated myself to a box of chocolates because I tried the Salted Vanilla and the Strawberry cheesecake and was blown away by the quality. Everything felt thoughtful and well-made. I’ll definitely be coming back to try out many more beautiful things that they have. Great addition to Edgbaston. Wonderful find. For the alternative breakfast it is just fabulous. My salmon and cream cheese croissant was delicious. The decaf cappuccino was also great. I wish I had time and appetite to go back for mid-morning pastries and afternoon tea. Maybe next year on my annual cricket jaunt. Cake & Culture is a delightful French-inspired patisserie in Edgbaston, Birmingham. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted with an inviting atmosphere and an array of beautifully crafted pastries and cakes that are as pleasing to the eye as they are to the palate.

10 out of 10👌 First visited this restaurant last summer with a friend and was amazed by the saffron rice so told my husband I would go with him cause he had to try this amazing rice
We were looking for somewhere to break our fast (iftar) and we decided to go here
We were 20 mins late to our booking due to the traffic in the city centre so I called and the person that answered just put the phone down, if it wasn’t Iftar time we would’ve gone elsewhere but due to how busy it would be everywhere else we decided to still go there
I called back and said we were 7 mins away and the time to break fast was 2 mins ago can I place my order via the phone so we can have it as soon as we get there but the person that took my call said no and put the phone down.. rude

We got there ordered our food and waited around half an hour.. do not get the mixed platter for 2 it’s a scam and so over priced for what you get.. but this is what the waiter pushed us to get
You’re better off getting two individual meals and the portions are a lot better and better value for money, the saffron rice was disappointing and was the only reason I wanted to go back.. was really bland
We noticed we were treated a lot different to the other customers as we were the only brown/muslim couple there and other tables were offered complimentary olives and sides etc.. where was ours? We got given little chunks of dried cookies to break our fast

I anticipated we may be slightly late so emailed to ask if we could move the brunch forward 30 minutes however no one responded.

We managed to arrive at our original time and drink and food orders were taken promptly. The food was nice and the variety of drinks kept everyone happy. Service was prompt.

Our brunch was due to finish at 3.30pm so the waitress came over at 3pm and said the brunch is finishing soon so can I get you some more drinks then I'll take your final order after that. Throughout the brunch we had been finishing our drinks in around 5-7 minutes. The waitress arrived at 3.15pm with our last drinks then promptly took payment for the brunch. We still had 15 minutes left of our 90 minutes, which we believed we could have easily had one more order. I have been to most of the bottomless brunches in Birmingham and also other places in the UK and usually the last order is taken at the end of the brunch.

When we questioned this, we were advised that our time started from when we started drinking, so my friend stated that we placed our drinks order at 2pm and didn't start drinking til after 2pm if that was the policy and the waitress said ""well I took your order at 2pm."" The argument we had was that we still had 15 minutes left of our brunch and they were taking our payment trying to get us off the table before the 90 minutes was up.

I feel we had a completely valid point and something that I have never come across at any other bottomless and that we asked politely, yet we were met with attitude from the waitress. Everything up until this point was great.

My recommendation would be that if you want to go to a bottomless brunch where you are actually given the whole 90 minutes as promised on the t&c's then to attend elsewhere! Lovely building and you can make your own gin has to be a good thing 😀 we had dinner before watching ELO over and out tour in his home town.
Great drinks and cocktails 🍸 dinner was delicious the menu had not been updated from the wab site so no Sunday dinners only ice for dessert!! should be better Went for the puppy experience. It was so good.
The dogs really enjoy themselves and are monitored really closely by the owner and staff.
After you get a large pizza it is basic but very nice and presented well. i came here with my boyfriend for a celebratory meal. the gin selection is fantastic, never seen so many options! we enjoyed all of the drinks that we tried which was a fair few! the food was okay, we got a starter each and then shared a pizza. we both agreed we should have just got a pizza each as it was a little smaller than we were expecting, but still fresh and delicious. we finished it off with a (very generous) portion of tiramisu to share, which was very good! i would definitely come back to sit in the beer garden in the sun, and get a whole pizza for myself! Fabulous service.  Very attentive staff.  Sunday roast lunch was superb.  Rib of Herefordshire beef was delicious as was the slow roasted lamb shoulder.  The gravy was to die for and so was the cauliflower cheese.   The whole meal tasted wonderfully homemade (in a very good way) not just a ""brake bros"" re-heat job like a lot of restaurants nowadays.

Will certainly come back.  Thinking about it...It was possibly the best Sunday roast I've ever had.  Certainly the best I can remember in a very long time.

Your bank is truly incompetent and useless — it’s been over a month now that I’ve had an issue with Apple Pay, and no one has been able to resolve it, neither over the phone nor in person. All I get is being passed around pointlessly. I’m deeply disappointed in your customer service.
Today, I even went to one of your branches in person, and one of your employees put me in a room for an hour and a half, called your customer service from there, took no responsibility whatsoever, and then just left me alone to deal with it while they went about their own tasks. I could’ve made that call from home myself!!!!!!what a complete waste of time!!!!!!!
In the end, my issue is still unresolved, and now my phone is practically useless. This situation is unacceptable.!!!

The taste is laughable, and the smell is straight-up nauseating. Who thought it was a good idea to serve fried chicken that's more grease than flavour? The 'secret recipe' must be a mix of stale herbs and regret. Avoid KFC like the plague unless you want to ruin your taste buds and your sense of smell. Pathetic. Absolutely disgusting, dirtiest one I’ve seen during my 30 years of life, overflowing bins, dirtiest table. The staff just standing around talking to each othe and not worried about the state of the restaurant. When the food finally came, it was lukewarm don’t recommend Had an amazing experience at KFC! The burger, roll, and chicken wings were served hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. Every bite was full of flavor. The staff were friendly, cooperative, and served with a smile, making the visit even better. Great food, great service — definitely coming back! Popped into the KFC at Battery Retail Park, Selly Oak on April 19th, and I must say, brilliant service! My order (12-piece Original Recipe Chicken) was ready incredibly fast despite a busy evening. The staff at the kiosk were efficient and courteous, and the food was piping hot and flavorful as always. Great value for money, and the takeaway process was smooth. I’ll definitely be returning for another quick and tasty meal. Highly recommend this branch! Yes it’s SO BAD here. Food orders are wrong 100% of time I go here, staff attitudes are severely lacking & they make it obvious that they hate you & their job. I only ever order the same thing: 4pc chicken on its own & 1x mini wrap (no salad & +hash brown - costs extra). They either still put on salad & miss out cheese, add cheese but don’t add the extra hash brown I paid for or they miss all of it & it’s literally chicken in a wrap with sauce. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. The chicken: it’s extremely hit & miss. It can either be sitting on the shelf for hours & is shrivelled, dry & the wrong type of crispy or you have to wait about 5-8 minutes & it’s tasty, fresh & just right. BUT… sadly it’s the size of the pieces that let it down further. You’ll get the odd decent size but some are so small you’re almost offended they thought you’d accept this. Other KFC’s will chuck in 2 small
pieces to count for one but this store never does. So you’re basically getting ripped off. The attitude of the staff is absolutely horrendous. I understand customer facing service roles are very stressful (I’ve done them myself as a young adult). But their attitudes well exceed that. You have all ethnicities, cultures, backgrounds which is nice - almost all are under the age of 25 & the immaturity def shows. I believe most are local students which is why they just don’t GAF. They display clearly that they hate their job & hate being here serving you. You do get the odd ONE semi friendly server who’ll advise how to order cheaper via a meal instead of individually for example, but it’s still monotone & there’s no eye contact. The foul and disgusted look you will get from the staff member who prepared your food when they are told by a colleague they need to remake food due to an error! It is akin to someone being told that not getting paid for 6 months of hard labour then spitting right in their face. Thats the exact look they give you. Just sheer disgust & they don’t even try to hide it. There also seems to be an issue with management. Many times I’ve gone shortly before closing yet they are frying large batches of chicken in an already dead restaurant, so either they’re keeping large amounts of chicken overnight to serve to you next day. Or they’re actually really nice & donating free KFC to local food banks, which I doubt. Most the staff regularly stand around with their elbows leaning on food preparation services talking to each other. I’ve seen the cooks turn off bleeping fryers with cooking utensils like tongs instead of their fingers. So basic hygiene is not being adhered to, imagine what’s going on behind the scene. Are they adhering to best before dates, appropriate poultry & meat handling?It is quite clean in there other than receipts, straw wrappers & crumbs on the floor. I’ve never seen it busy so can’t comment on how quick they clean the tables after use. There are self service kiosks where you can order & pay without using the counter but it’s very hard to customise or ask for specific pieces of chicken like breast or leg. This is not always honoured anyway. Easy to park as there is a small car park with about 20 spaces. Uber riders / drivers will take up all of the closest Spaces to the entrance as well as make their own next yours & on pavement outside. So try to park away from the entrance to avoid scratches to your vehicle. Open till 11 pm on most nights which is convenient. Only stones throw from Birmingham uni student accom so 90% of customers are students so you do get some silly behaviour especially from the groups. Try to go at non-peak times to avoid any rush from nearby retail park as it is based inside battery retail park. I’ve never seen the car park full but if it ever is you can park in battery retail park, I think both car parks are free for up to 2 hours But do check the signs as contracts change and may have since my review",0.4,0.6,"[""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

I was first let in by the very nice bouncers however once at the bar I was then again asked for my id. After looking at it for one second I was told I could not be served as ‘it was not a British id’. They then told me that it was their policy to not let in anyone not British as although my parents ARE English I am from Belgium. This had never been an issue since moving to the uk. The server then walked off and ignored us. Not only do I think I was not served because I was not born in this country but also due to the fact that I am visibly queer. Would never recommend giving any money to such a backwards and old fashioned establishment. So me and my family come in and some one decided to kick us out she has short shaved hair and was very rude taking photos of us I tried to get image as I don’t know her name she was a rude member   of staff and I don’t appreciate it what so ever … my sister knocked over a board and said she was too drunk even tho she was not and I’m sorry but if I can write this now it will go to show you that I am not drunk (my sister went to reach out to pay bill and knocked over the board this is the most pathetic thing in the world and I would love some one to call me back regarding this case many thanks ell) I went here with my young toddler children. I am a British born asian man. People kept staring at us all the time. This made me and my children feel extremely uncomfortable. We were only there for about 15 minutes and we left because of the constant stares. They made us feel really unwelcome. Everybody in the pub was white. Avoid this pub if you are not white as you will get bad looks from staff and other people in the pub. It was a very unpleasant experience. Didn't realise it was a whites only pub by the looks of it. This is disgusting considering we are now modern times. The pub needs to clean up its act and cater for all regardless of race or nationality. We are humans at the end of day. God made different races. The world does consist of just white people! If you are afte a traditional pub in the heart of Harborne then this is the place. There are no 'heirs or graces' here and you may well appreciate it.
This is an old school honest public house.
It has the modern amenities but you will simply come here for a pint and feel the community spirit.
The value for money here is crazy so if you are on a budget you need look no further.

Update 27th April 2025: Not a good visit at all today. Had a Guinness. Everyone else was served first when it was clear mt turn was overlooked. Asked if the match volume coul dbe turned on but told no , yet when others asked it was put on immiditaly. And then to top it all off, when I got halfway down the Guinness I discovered the glass had a huge filthy mark on the inside. Hadn't been cleaned when filled. Made me feel physically sick and I left it and the pub and probably wont ever return. Downgraded accordingly. I feel queezy even now thinking about it.

Food doesn’t take too long and is always hot and fresh, plus free refills on hot drinks. Frequently excessive waits. Waiting for half an hour then they couldn't find the order. Often understaffed. Quality of food is low. Overpriced particularly as you can buy the same stuff downstairs for less eg a bottle of coke. We fancied some brunch, so we visited the Morrisons Cafe. The last time we went was before lockdown, and the cafe has definitely had a glow up. We ordered the Full Veggie Breakfast: which consists of two vegan recipe sausages, quarter avocado, fried egg, flat mushroom, grilled tomato half, hash brown, Heinz Baked Beans and toast. They gave the option to swap out any of the items for something else, and we chose to swap out the egg and sausages for extra hash browns, as the hash browns from the Morrisons Cafe are unbeatable! The hash browns were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, the perfect hash browns!

The interior of the cafe was spacious and there was plenty of seating area. There were tables for two as well as tables for larger groups, which we thought was very convenient. We were sat at a table near the window, so we had a view whilst we were having brunch.
We really enjoyed the breakfast and we will definitely be back soon! I’m not a fan of this new style service , where there’s no staff anywhere. The machine gave no receipt and seems likely didn’t accept my more card as I do not appear to have had my bonus points. The cafe is bright and clean and wasn’t too busy it took 10 minutes to get our food, which is fine. The food was fine but as I wasn’t able to specify well done bacon wasn’t really to my liking. Whilst I understand the reason for taking away the sauces, it does feel a bit tight. The cappuccino was nice enough and free refills are a bonus if you like a lot of coffee!! The toilets were a state which I find unusual for a Morrisons. I only had a small breakfast which is what I would normally have but it really didn’t feel enough, but it’s reasonable value at £5.50. I’m unlikely to return due to not being able to specify exactly how I want my food. The food served here is good—I have no issues with the quality at all. However, the coffee wasn’t as hot as I’d like it to be. They do offer free refills, but since the first cup wasn’t great, I didn’t take them up on it. The service could use some improvement; it’s not particularly attentive or efficient. Additionally, the cleanliness of the place leaves something to be desired—it often feels a bit untidy.

On the plus side, the prices are very affordable, so for the cost, it’s hard to complain too much. It’s a budget-friendly option, but there are definitely areas that could be better, like the coffee temperature, service, and overall cleanliness.",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Breakfast""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

The burger was excellent and the topping choices made it very customisable. I was warned you got a lot of fries ... But I didn't listen and went large. I have as many fries left over now I have finished as I have eaten. I went for the spicy and they were quite hot (more than anticipated) and very filling. Drink is very expensive, but you get free refills. You really need to get a refill to make it any sort of value.

Overall it is expensive for what you get, but the food is good. Maybe do it for a treat occasionally. Food and service was brilliant! I'm a slow eater but I devoured my burger in 5 minutes. Easily the best burger I ever had. You were able to customise your burger and add the perfect toppings for you! Person taking orders was nice and made sure everything would be perfect for us. The bacon was too crispy, like crackling and it was have been better with paper plates. There was a security guard which made me feel less welcome but it was brilliant 😊 Food is really nice especially with the grill onion add-on highly recommend it. Not going to be coming back anytime soon. Let me tell you why.

For a spend of £15-£18 there are much better places. McDonalds, Smashburger, Burger & Sauce, Nandoes all have better food for a lesser price. In these places it will cost you likely less than that for a meal. You get delicious fries, burgers, anything and usually very well made.

For £18 I got a paper bag with a burger that had a very cold bun and overly chewy beef. One side of it was absolutely caked in sauce so much it was really messy to eat and ingredients constantly slipped out. All of this was wrapped in a foil like I were having a packed lunch.

Then over that foil-wrapped burger was a cup of fries and a ton more fries dumped on top. As for the drink it was great but that's a given since it's dispensed from a freestyle machine.

The flavour was fine but nothing great. It had the All In ingredients and tasted nice and the chips were fine too but the price is a huge let down for me along with how the burger was served. Would have much rather gone to Nandoes or Smashburger.

For a £8-10 meal, great if the burger is served properly. For the £15-18 mark absolutely not. Food is good as usual, only a few people in the bar. But unfortunately, the table is not clean.

Rude on the phone when trying to follow up on my food that I'd paid for. When it arrived the food was cold and soggy. I’ve been ordering food from here for a while never had a issue. The food gets delivered in the given time. The Mix grill platter is nice goes perfectly with the rice & bread. Donner meat wrap was nice plenty of meat salad the amount  sources was just right. The worst food ever by far. I’m warning everyone to not waste their money. I promise there is better Turkish food at other places. The food here is stale, cold and dry. They give about 2 piece of meat and that’s it. The service is very poor. The worst place to eat in the world if you ask me. The food was tasting so bad, the person who served us was not smiling.

It was fun to dance on tables and chairs, but it would’ve been nice to have a bit more floor space to dance as everyone was having to stay seated or at the table they chose for most of the time as it was so packed.

The toilets were not up to my standards and they’re very small, so people were queueing to go.

I didn’t get to try the food, but it smelled amazing😌 Popped in for a game of darts and pool while watching the football. Fairly reasonably priced with a nice selection of beers. Plenty of pool tables so even though it was busy you could still get a table. The Dart boards have seen better days and could do with being renewed. I didn’t have any food but what I saw being served looked ok. The staff were really friendly. Never had the food, but I visit here often enough, the 2 American pool tables closest to the bar/darts area are a utter nightmare to play on, as there are a few of the pockets which fall out, so you have to then run the balls down that are rolling all over the place and they have various areas of water damage on the linings, which makes resting ones hands in one of them spots an awful feeling so please sort things out. As I feel it ruins the experience as the music there is often a vibe for the younger ear, so it's not a bad place just needs a few improvements.

Oh, the roof keepings leaking as well and some of the sticks are missing the pads from the top or there weighs but other than that, it's okay could be much better,  would I recommend No- will I still frequent possibly. So refub needed I feel, as the seating and painting on the walls were nice additions but the roof, tables and sticks there need to be upgraded with brand new ones asap. The staff are all pleasant and well mannered, so it's only being let down by the quality of the items there.

Lastly, the placement of the tables are  too close together so there are times where I've been bumped into mid aim of my turn which has resulted in me missing my shot or giving 2 goes away, cause the neighbouring table are way less than a pool stick away,  so maybe remove the top 2 tables and organise the space better. The venue feels abandoned and dirty, even on a weekend evening. The staff was so unenthusiastic that it put me off from the start.

We came to play darts and it wasn't a great experience. The board was placed in the worst location with people (including staff) constantly walking past and stopping us from playing. Also, there was no sponge to wipe the board after the game and we asked a staff member for one, but instead she came over to do it and took like 5 minutes rubbing it for no reason!

Overall the place felt very unwelcoming and I'd much rather choose a different bar. The photos on this venue’s website are misleading. If they are of this location, they've been carefully selected and edited to portray a lively, well-kept place – but the reality is far from it.

We were extremely disappointed, especially as we had specifically booked to play pool. The tables and cues were, at best, poor quality. This is a venue with zero love or care invested in it. They’re clearly busy enough to overlook maintenance, and it shows.

When we picked up our cues from reception, they were in a tattered and shabby state. As we set up, we noticed there was no triangle on our table. After asking a staff member, I was told to “borrow one from another table,” as though it were normal to lack such basic equipment. Shocked, I asked if each table had its own triangle and was told, surprisingly casually, that they did not.

Imagine a pool club with battered tables, worn-out cues, and no basic equipment at each table, requiring players to interrupt others mid-game to borrow what they need. For me, this experience was not just disappointing but downright shameful. Based on this, I will not visit another Bierkeller again.",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC""]"

The environment was comfortable, the food was delicious, and the staff was very professional. They explained each food in detail to the guests, and their service attitude was of the caliber of a star hotel. Ordered the specials and it was so tasty, fresh and filling.
One of the best calamari I have tasted in the UK. It wasn't oily, the batter was tasty and you could actually taste the squid. Highly recommend. Wondered where on earth we'd come to when the taxi arrived. I needn't have been worried though. Lovely little restaurant. Proper Italian feel to it. Great choice from the menu and specials. Lady serving us was absolutely lovely. Came in tonight on a date with my boyfriend (we were unsure of where to eat and tried here for the first time), the staff are super friendly and welcoming! (They made the experience super enjoyable!!) the food was fantastic too, I had the spaghetti poplette and my boyfriend had a calzone and we shared some calamari!! The food is decently priced and I will definitely be coming here again :) thank you very much!

There is a young girl that works there, I’m not sure of her name but she was absolutely lovely too! A hidden gem and locals favourite. The restaurant provides a cozy atmosphere with welcoming staff.
Homemade tortellini with spinach and ricotta cheese - tortellinis are huge, with creamy butter and sage sauce.
Mezzalune della casa - the mushroom sauce is rich in flavour and complements the whole dish.
Cotoletta alla Bolognese - a traditional Italian dish.

The food was absolutely unreal-every dish was a masterpiece of flavor, creativity, and precision. The attention to detail in both presentation and taste was incredible, making each course a true experience rather than just a meal.
The atmosphere was edgy yet inviting, and the service was impeccable, with knowledgeable staff who made the evening even more enjoyable. Every bite was a journey of bold, unexpected flavors that left us completely amazed.
If you're looking for an unforgettable dining experience in Birmingham, The Wilderness is an absolute must-visit. I can't wait to go back! The Rough Cut menu

While sitting there, the aroma coming from the kitchen made you feel like you were on holiday next to someone BBQing.

The first dish was good. I was expecting it to be salty. It was creamy, with four flavours all taking their turns to excite your taste buds.

The second dish was so fresh and seasonal.

The cod was different. I like it more as a winter dish.

The BBQ mussels dish had lots going on. If you could just hook it straight to my veins.

The showstopper, the duck. This was mind-blowing. I could have this as a Sunday dinner. Almost as a chef teasing you with a trailer, then bam, you get the start of the show. I hope this becomes a regular dish.

Last, we have the banana dish. This left you refreshed. The wilderness is fantastic! The food was tasty, seasoned well and wonderfully presented. The staff were friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is great. Great playlist too! 😊 I'd recommend it to anyone coming to Birmingham Loved it! The flavours conjured up were inspired. I mean a first course called Big Mac. And it tasted just like a Big Mac with a mix of the cheese, mayo, gherkin and tomato flavours with an amazing beef tartare. Wow. Every course was incredible. Go. Our first time fine dining and it was amazing! The food is rich with flavour and melts in your mouth. Now I understand why people do this.

Pret is a great meeting place and location to sit and watch the train arrival and departures on the digital screens opposite. It has a secluded seeing area with comfy chairs and tables away from all the passers-by. Nice and relaxing. The staff are always so friendly here. I don’t pass through Birmingham often, but will always visit this coffee shop over others because of how great the staff are. I was given a free breakfast bowl this morning which is such a nice surprise after an early start. I had a similarly great experience a few years ago after a really awful train journey, at night or in the morning the staff are always wonderful and welcoming. (I also like the vegan options at Pret and the food, but this location is above the rest). Very quick and efficient service too. On Friday 17th May, around 8:30pm @ Birmingham New street station, I Went to buy a coffee and Prets famous delicious chocolate cookies. I was greeted by a member of staff ( 3 staff members was working ) who had such an infectious, warm , pleasant & welcoming attitude. Their professionalism and dedication to provided great customer service was appreciated after missing my train. They where able to answer my random questions about your ( Prets ) coffees to making my drinks order just the way I requested. It was extremely refreshing and touching to receive such warm customers service in a world that is always so busy, on the move & like a conveyor belt.
I watched their customer service after mine as I waited for my train, each customer receiving that same level of service, this is rare,  in a fast paste, technology world we sometimes forgets the importance of good customer service.
Thank you Birmingham new street staff for the impeccable service. Sold me an absolutely most stale croissant. I would expect at £2.90 a fresh one at least. It was also not baked through - sooo bad, absolutely fuming. I was so hungry when I got to the office and couldn't even eat that. The customer service was bad too, didn't offer a napkin, didn't offer a receipt.😞 Should have gone to Gregg's Price mark up compared to other city centre Prets. £7.20 for an eat-in veggie baguette and a table stained with someone else's coffee and sweetcorn. Same baguette costs £5.99 eat-in in the branch inside Selfridges, so at New Street the customer is charged £1.20 for the dirty table.

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Onto the 3rd and final lounge on my Birmingham tour, ended up at Le Mirage. Upon entering we were asked to take a seat anywhere we liked so we decided to seat in these booth style sofa right at the end, seating was comfortable. Decided to order something we haven’t tried before so green ice pops it was. Shisha came out within 10 minutes in a old school ice chamber pipe, might be a KM but unsure we were also given disposable pipes. Shisha was good but the flavour died down within 30-40 minutes and this was because of the Egyptian head they use I tend to find these types of bowls give off a more harsher smoke. Lounge was big in size with plenty of seating. Price since you are in Birmingham is pretty decent and cards are accepted. Parking is a bit difficult as the roads have parking restrictions but if there’s a space on the pavement you just dump your car there. Vibe was good it was getting busier just as we were leaving. Overall a decent lounge to visit with hot food and desserts also served. Really nice place, visiting from London so not local to the area. The shisha was lovely and at such a good price, food was okay and had a ferrero rocher milkshake, was nice. Service was okay and we got given personal heaters as it was cold. Cute little booths and quite a big lounge, only thing is parking, only double yellow nearby. Would recommend though, I will defo be coming back here again. Nice place nice shisha respectful
Staff would deffo recommend Decent place. Shisha is a good price. Probably add more As it burns very quickly. Food and dessert available. Customer service is good. Decor is also nice. Drinks were alright but wasn’t a fan of the candy floss drink as the glass got so sticky. Parking available outside.
