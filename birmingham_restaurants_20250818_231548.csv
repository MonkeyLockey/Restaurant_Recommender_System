I think there's the odd chef that isn't up to the standards of the others, but to be honest, I've never thought to complain. It's pretty darn ok, ya know.

I recently stayed at Malmaison Birmingham for two nights and had a truly wonderful experience. From the moment I arrived, the staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and professional they really set the tone for a great stay.

The room was spotless, stylish, and very comfortable. Everything felt fresh and well-maintained, making it easy to relax. I was also impressed with the breakfast a fantastic spread with delicious options that really exceeded expectations.

The location couldn’t be better right in the heart of Birmingham, making it super convenient to get around and explore the city. Everything was easy to find and navigate.

The only small suggestion I’d make is that I would have appreciated being told about the spa services at check-in. I only found out about them through the in room leaflet, and it would’ve been great to know earlier to plan ahead.

Overall, an amazing stay and I’d happily return. Highly recommended!",2025-05-18 23:21:41,en

Perfect location (opposite New St station) and close to many bars and restaurants etc. However, just outside of the hotel was really run down and derelict.

They didn't fix it and told me I couldn't move rooms as most of the rooms didn't have air conditioning working either.

Very convenient location: shops, public transport links, and other conveniences within walking distance and was seemingly safe in terms of security.
Great value for money.
Although staff were very friendly, helpful and assisting when they were there, there were many occasions when there was absolutely nobody at the front desk, so waiting for someone to be able to assist you at all was often a matter of waiting 10 minutes (approx), so I would suggest having 2 people at the front desk for each shift always, so even if 1 is gone away, the other will still be there. I would also suggest having in-room telephones.
The only other slightly disappointing factor was if we are staying more than 1 night, housekeeping is not done in the room unless requested before 12pm, which I didn’t realise until after that, and I wished the cups and mugs were changed and stock on water bottles and chocolate were replenished.

We luckily came back to the hotel early around 7pm, but there were people hanging around the entrance that appeared drugged up.

The noise from the street drummers was so loud into the room, that it was either close the window and boil or listen to the noise...whilst the drumming was acceptable the foul language of the other people on the street that continued through out the night and again early morning  around 4am (with window shut) was enough to disturb sleep. The noise was so bad outside, that we also heard the local law enforcement trying to break it up.

Then around 7am you could hear the next door room watching a law drama, it was loud enough that I could follow the whole show from the otherside of our room.

The room was small but also of a degraded quality, if I had realised the travel lodge was so close, I would have booked in there instead.",2025-08-10 10:56:01,en

Food is always good. Wine list caters to all budgets. And they have great seafood dishes.

There are two levels to the restaurant and we were sat at a table tucked away which was great. Lots of mirrors with a ceiling full of artificial roses. It’s over the top but suits the venue and adds to the experience.

Great wine. Lots of Italian choices. We had a couple bottles of the primitivo after a round of negronis (pleased an Italian place can make these well too)

My starter was overdone under the grill. I’ve had the baked aubergine parmagiano many times and this unfortunately wasn’t their best. Monkfish tagliatelle and the shared dessert more than made up for it.

The dessert was three mini portions per person and a limoncello shot for £9 each. Great value.

Will look forward to my next visit.",2025-04-27 15:13:05,en

The oysters were fabulous—nice and big, just how we like them!

The pizza, unfortunately, was a bit underwhelming. It was light on toppings, which made it lack flavor. We also tried the seafood grill main, which really could’ve used some salt, garlic, and chili to bring it to life.

Food was delicious overall and in generous portions which is a bonus. Calamari was good, freshly fried and still crispy with some squid flavour instead of a rubber in most Italian restaurants. My frutti de mare was good, loads of seafood, probably the pasta is overcooked a bit to my taste. But I like the subtle spicy that bring the dish better.

We were seated promptly at our table time and were brought a complimentary nibble with our popadoms, whilst we eagerly awaited our starter.  We chose a sharing platter starter of chicken, lamb, salmon and king prawn which was absolutely devine!  For our mains my husband chose a chicken dish in traditional curry style and I chose beef cheek on a dahl base.  This was accompanied by pilau rice, plain naan and peshwari naan.  Both dishes were excellent, although I was expecting the beef to have more Indian spicing - still delicious!  The naans were lovely and fluffy and very fresh.  Portions were very generous and we couldn't quite finish our dishes.  We both then enjoyed chocolate fondant desserts with pistachio ice-cream.  The evening was a real treat and we were looked after well by Vivek who regularly checked in with us to make sure everything was ok.  Would definitely return.",2025-03-24 16:23:29,en

The food and service are very good here, I've never been overly indulgent when it comes to Italian cuisine but when eating here me and my cousin always overorder but finish the lot, each time we come our bill is always over £140 as we do like to try a bit of everything.
No regrets BTW.

The pasta dishes are perfectly flavoured and if you have any meat dishes, they are top-notch with very little to critique from a negative POV.

The restaurant's decor is lovely, you easily feel at home here with it being decorated sympathetically.

The only negative I had was this visit we were seated upstairs, it was lovely up there but very quiet. When we got seated it was only us on the whole floor and (at a guess) with seating for probably at least 60 diners.
It did have a few tables through the night but was very quiet up there which is not what we're used to.
But hey, I'm seriously picking minor details up here.

Overall a solid night out at this place with a cracking environment, staff and most importantly food 👌

The welcome at reception was just fantastic (from Vanessa I recall her name being?), who was lovely and couldn't do enough. The room (502) has a large bath (the bathroom is great, really decent size) and massive deep sink.
There's an iron and ironing board, hairdryer l, a big fan (it was a warm day) and teas, coffee, hot chocolate and bottled water (with biscuits) all in the price. Beautifully comfy double bed too and a decent sized wall mounted tv.

This place is absolutely spotless too.

The staff are all super nice and the service is kind and efficient.

Honestly, I'm amazed at how brilliant it all is fornthe almost free price. I cant praise it highly enough - we love it so much we've booked another night (41 quid).

Ooh, the bar area too - again, flawless. Great service, nice staff, the bar is perfect, it just screams ""well managed"". The Freedom breakfast is the best £3.99 you're ever going to spend.

The second time we weren’t rushing as much and were lucky enough to have the same lovely waitress who was cheerful and made our visit really nice. Will definitely be back soon!! Food was really really nice, and made use of the O2 offer which got the order from £45 to £25!",2025-04-23 22:57:22,en

As someone who often finds veggie options to be a bit of an afterthought at Chinese restaurants, Chung Ying was a refreshing exception.

Their vegetarian dim sum menu is genuinely thoughtful, not just the usual spring rolls and tofu. The standout for me was the vegetable cheung fun—silky rice noodle rolls filled with perfectly seasoned mushrooms and greens, drizzled with a sweet soy sauce that tied everything together beautifully. The vegetarian siu mai and spinach dumplings were also excellent: delicate, flavorful, and clearly made with care.

What I appreciated most was that nothing felt like a compromise. Every dish was well-balanced and satisfying, with textures and flavors that made each bite interesting. Even the dipping sauces were spot on, complementing the dishes rather than overpowering them.

The staff, wearing smiles as their uniform, made me feel like a cherished guest. From the very moment I walked in, I knew this was going to be a delightful experience.

Let me tell you about the Almond Croissant – a heavenly creation with a flaky crust that seemed to melt in my mouth. The almond cream filling was like a secret treasure, rich and velvety. This wasn't just a pastry; it was a work of art, carefully crafted to perfection.

But the surprises didn't stop there. The Banana Caramel Muffin was a symphony of flavors – sweet banana dancing with luscious caramel. And that topping? It wasn't just a topping; it was like a delicious crown, adding a crunch that was incredibly satisfying. Believe me, this treat is a journey you won't want to miss.

Then, there was the Blueberry Muffin – a burst of tangy and sweet berries in every bite. The sugar-crusted top was like a sweet secret waiting to be discovered with every mouthful. I couldn't help but close my eyes and savor the blissful moment.

The pain au Chocolat was a rendezvous with sophistication. With each bite, it was like I was transported to a charming French café. The fusion of flavors was like a dance of elegance and comfort in my mouth.

And let's not forget the Chocolate Twist – it was like a playful game of hide and seek with chocolate surprises. Every twist revealed a burst of cocoa goodness, and it was perfect for anyone with a love affair with chocolate.

So, here's my advice: plan a visit to Starbucks, indulge in these delightful creations, and then come back to thank me for introducing you to this world of taste and wonder. Your taste buds will thank you!",2023-08-16 02:29:51,en

It is best described as fusion: Nepalese meets Indian meets British hipster. The light pours in from the skylight giving the comfortable, lounging dining area an inviting warmth.
The service is exceptional, the concept of JoJolapa, it’s dishes and its soul are explained in detail. I recommend letting them guide you. Go on, try dishes that will open your chakra to a whole new world of food.
The pick of the dishes, for me, was the soya tikka biriyani. If I was to describe it better, it is a Nan topped rice and (Meat,vegetables,vegan meat) pie delivered with a side of curry sauce. What an amazing dish; I had to ask the serving staff if they’d accidentally served me actual chicken given how convincing the soya chicken was.

Not the freshest sushi I’ve had, and the presentation was rather plain, but portions were generous and satisfying. With more refined plating, it could be even better.

🍱 Children’s Bento
Served in a fun, train shaped tray that immediately caught the kids’ attention! Includes fried chicken, prawn, rice ball, tamagoyaki, fruit, and a cup of apple juice. Well balanced and filling, the kids were delighted!

🍜 Mount Fuji Giant Prawn Ramen
Comes with two large fried prawns and dumplings. Even though the fried items were soaked in the soup, they stayed flavorful. The tonkotsu broth was rich and aromatic without being overly salty.

🍹 Melon Cream Soda
A nostalgic Japanese treat! Classic melon soda with a scoop of ice cream. Tastes great and perfect for photos.

Unfortunately, my recent experiences at the Birmingham New Street branch have left me quite disappointed due to the behavior of one of the employees, Afyia.

On multiple occasions, I’ve noticed that she rarely smiles or makes an effort to be welcoming. It often feels like customers are not valued when she’s around. Today was the tipping point. She came outside to collect chairs and tables, but instead of politely asking customers to move, she raised her voice and demanded, “Excuse me, we’re going to take the chairs inside now!” The tone was aggressive and commanding, which made me and others feel extremely uncomfortable.

What bothered me most was that there were plenty of other chairs available that could have been taken first, but she felt the need to target a few customers and rush them in such an impolite way. There was no reason for this kind of behavior. Basic courtesy goes a long way, and it’s disheartening to see this lack of professionalism, especially at a place like Starbucks where customer service should be a priority.

Great coffee is available everywhere these days, but customer service is what sets businesses apart. I hope Starbucks addresses this issue at the Birmingham New Street branch, as it’s not the experience I expect from a brand I’ve been loyal to for years.",2024-09-28 19:57:08,en

Of course, it depends on what you’re looking for, but we personally didn’t enjoy our visit.

The service felt very intense, almost like the staff were looking down on us. I get that they have a certain etiquette, but true professionalism means adapting to each customer’s mood and experience – not making them feel uncomfortable. The food itself wasn’t bad, but for a Michelin-rated place, it didn’t blow us away.

We went with a Groupon voucher gifted to us, and were surprised when the bill included a hefty service charge of the full price menu, instead of just charging on top of drinks. I understand that some fine-dining places automatically include service, and normally I’m happy to pay it – if the service matches. But what if it’s young students or guests who received it as a gift and weren’t expecting to be hit with an extra £40–£50? Definitely something worth considering.

What bothered me most was that while filming parts of the experience (which is common in fine dining these days), the waiter told me not to film him as he presented the food. I wasn’t filming him directly – just capturing the overall experience. If you’re working in a high-end, presentation-focused restaurant, you should expect that some guests will be recording. If that’s an issue, maybe a different work environment would suit better.

Overall, the food was decent but not unforgettable, and you can absolutely find better Michelin-level restaurants where the service is warm, respectful, and genuinely customer-focused. Sadly, this one didn’t live up to expectations.",2025-05-12 10:48:46,en

Little did I know that when we arrived if was infact Santorini.  Not a good start when some of the Hens had had bad experiences at Santorini.
Anyhow, we arrive after I had booked it over 3 months ago for the table not to be ready (felt like we were not booked).
Tables set for a group of originally 26 but was for 24.  We were crammed in so setting the tables up with activities for the night it was a challenge.all the seat covers were minging and very dirty.

Before the guests had arrived food had been placed on the tables all with  small plates.
Stupidly we thought that we would eat what was on the table, have a break and then onto the mains... how wrong was I... the food kept coming with nothing to serve the food out with, so we were all double dipping.
The food was lovely however we all sat down and 7.40 and food was all out by 8.30.  Most of the food was wasted which is awful in this day and age.  We were offered boxes to take away but how could we, the food had been double if not quadruple dipped and left out for hours.
Drinks service was a joke too we waited ages to be served and when they arrived most drinks were forgotten.
I had travelled from Cannock for this special night and had spent many hours preparing, but was totally let down.  The floor was slippy and two of the guests had slipped badly on the floor and when deserts came, there was no additional plates nor forks or spoons it was a case of hands only.
The tables were full of plates, glasses etc to the point we moved them onto the sides to be able to access the tops of the tables.
Finally, the night was over by 10pm and we were been headed to pay.  We'll what was supposed to be £25.00 each some of us were charged 27.50... the owner wanted us to pay for service so he could pay his staff. This is what he said to me on several occasions.

I feel this place falsely advertises and offer the world when you look at the website.  I was expecting a late night but after arriving for the 7.30pm booking we had all left at 10.30pm.  The DJ was supposed to start at 11pm but that was oviousley not right as all hen parties had left around the same time.  Downstairs had a few people in but apart from.that it was obvious that the night had ended.

I'm gutted as the experience was utterly shocking.  The food was lovely and I feel that the chefs are been let down as the food was really nice but due to the service been poor and rushed with no change of plates nor serving cutlery it was sad.
Finally the floor is slippery and two.of the guests fell and one has had to.go to A&E die.to the fall and once reporting the fall the owner dismissed it and said he didn't see her fall but he has cameras.  No accident book!!!  Also when the plates were smashed those on the dance floor were close to the action and one.of.our guests foot was cut by a plate when it was smashed

If you choose to go as a big group collect the cash before hand and pay in bulk otherwise people will be charged more and perhaps don't bother as its a let down.  Such a shame as they are normally amazing nights out.",2025-03-23 16:44:43,en

The venue has a great vibe — intimate enough to feel connected to the performance, yet big enough to handle a solid crowd without feeling cramped. The sound quality was impressive; every instrument came through clearly, and the vocals were spot on, which really brought the energy of the night to life.

The layout of the venue is smart, with decent views of the stage from most areas, and the tiered levels in the main room make it easier to see even if you’re not right at the front. The lighting setup added to the atmosphere, especially during high-energy tracks, and the acoustics made the whole experience even more immersive.

Staff and security were professional, friendly, and handled everything smoothly — from ticket checks to helping people find their way around. Entry was well organized and the bar staff were quick, even at peak times, which is always appreciated at a packed show.

Facilities were clean and well maintained, and the cloakroom was handy for storing jackets and bags. If I had to nitpick, the drinks were a little on the expensive side — not outrageous, but enough to notice. Still, that’s not unusual for live venues and didn’t take away from the night.

Overall, the O2 Academy Birmingham is a top-tier venue for live music. It’s got everything you need for a great night out and consistently delivers a quality concert experience. I’ll definitely be back for more gigs.",2025-04-11 19:11:16,en

CASH FREE RESTAURANT.
Half term is time to find the bestie places to go with kids.

This week we chose Pizza Hut because said that kids eat for free when you spend £10, BUT IS ONE KID FOR EVERY TRANSACTION, If you have a family with more that one child you only will get one child free at least that you do separate purchases for the food.
We do not make a booking before coming to the place, we has been there before and wasn’t so busy, but is half term so the best option is make in advance.

The Manager very friendly find the way to gives us a table, after one of the staff said that were very busy.

You have to scan QR code to make you order and pay online.

If you buy the promo for the buffet time is brilliant, you will have fresh pizzas, actually you can see when come out from the oven, the variety is very good and the salads island is okay, but I’m not a salad person.

And have refill with drinks and ice cream is absolutely amazing, specially if you want give a reward to your kids after hard work at school, plus have kids that finish SATs, deserve every penny that you spend.

Buy have no space for ramp or lift.

Was full of people but is okay, when you have kids you can manage be in a noise atmosphere.

However, today, I left this place extremely disappointed. Here’s why:
1.	Atmosphere and Ambiance:
As soon as we entered, there was an overwhelming stuffy smell; the kitchen odors hit you right in the face. Everything looked very messy, disorganized, and worn out.
2.	Cleanliness:
There were dirty used forks and napkins on the floor, and the staff were stepping over them as they walked by. The tables were sticky with grease and sauce stains from previous customers and had not been cleaned properly.
3.	Taste:
Both my meal and my spouse’s meal were served cold. The salads inside had no oil, no salt, and no dressing. The fries were also cold. We were both honestly shocked.
4.	Restrooms:
I was very surprised to see that the male and female restrooms were right next to each other without any separation. This is a basic expectation considering the general clientele of a halal restaurant. In fact, even many British restaurants ensure this comfort with separate entrances for men and women. I was very surprised and disappointed. Moreover, the restrooms were extremely dirty.
5.	Music:
There was very loud pub-style music with heavy bass playing. It was extremely overwhelming. Of course, music could be adjusted easily, but their choice of music shows how disconnected they are from the spirit of this business.

I truly did not want to write a negative review, but I felt I had to, with much regret and disappointment. I sincerely hope this feedback is taken seriously and improvements are made because German Döner is a brand — and this branch does not reflect the brand’s reputation at all. I am sorry to say this.",2025-04-27 10:38:47,en

Pepe’s on Coronation Street is a great spot for delicious, flavorful grilled chicken. The sauces and seasoning are always on point, and the portions are generous. The menu has a good variety, and the sides complement the meals well.

However, the chicken can sometimes be a little dry, which takes away from the otherwise great taste. When it’s cooked just right, it’s amazing, but the consistency could be improved.

Me and my partner had ordered 2 chicken tasca meals on Deliveroo. This is something we occasionally order and enjoy, and we called up the store to specially ask for no siraccha on them as I’m allergic and my partner doesn’t like spice. The woman on the phone didn’t seem to listen properly but I trusted it as I have never had an issue before this. The order arrives and I can already see the siraccha dripping out of both of my tascas. I called up the store to ask them to re send them out, and the same lady answered and told me ‘we will just do better next time’, yet I’ve just wasted £40 on my dinner that I now cannot eat. I got passed on to a manager who told me to get a refund through Deliveroo, and I expressed how this is a joke as I wanted my dinner and would then have to wait 3-5 days for the money to come back into my bank. Very disgusted with the customer service and the lack of care when we are going out of our way to specially ask for changes on the order, I really suggest this branch trains their staff better with how to deal with customers, as I used to work at the Sutton Coldfield branch and we would have all our front of house staff well trained with better manners.

A decent pint of Guinness and ok service let down by sub par food and general cleanliness of the places (see photos). Food was ok nothing great not really worth the price you pay. Was given a dirty knife(see photos) basic requirement would be to at least give clean cutlery. The place needs a serious revamp starting to look run down.

We were warmly welcomed by the friendly staff, which made a great first impression.

We ordered the mix platter for three people and waited about 20 minutes for the food to arrive. In the meantime, the restaurant kindly served us a portion of bread with salad, yogurt, and chili sauce  a nice touch! The bread was especially tasty and crispy.

The platter included a generous mix of meats: kebabs, ribs, and wings. Everything was delicious, and the ribs were particularly good. However, I would suggest adding a bit more doner kebab to the platter, as it was very flavorful but not in large enough portions.

Overall, we really enjoyed the food. One minor suggestion: it would have been more convenient if we were provided with spoons for the rice. Also, while the service was friendly, it could have been slightly more attentive.

All in all, we had a pleasant experience and may return if we're in the area again.",2025-07-21 23:22:11,en

The restaurant is beautiful inside very clean and minimalistic. We were welcomed by Lucy who was amazing throughout the whole dinner. She made sure we had a lovely time and was friendly and cheerful but professional at the same time.
The restaurant offers a tasting menu and plenty of drinks options including a wine pairing.
Every single dish was unique on its own way and had some amazing flavours. In addition, each dish was beautifully presented. Some of my personal favourites were the Wye valley asparagus with exmoor caviar and whey sauce, a simple dish but with some unique and delicious flavours. Another favourite was the A5 Wagyu beef with grilled chicory.
There is an option to add a cheese selection before moving onto desserts and it was absolutely worth it, some delicious British cheeses with home made crackers, apple preserve and home made malt loaf.
The desserts were absolutely beautiful and tasted incredible. The sourdough cake with rye custard and brown butter ice cream was loved by everyone on the table. The petit fours at the end were the perfect finish of an amazing dinner. The sunflower seeds macarons and freshly baked madeleines were delicious. The madeleines are baked to order and still warm when served.
We even had a chat with Ben- the chef who makes all the amazing food, he was lovely.

It’s a very small and intimate setting, with one room, a central bar/barista/service area, and a kitchen with large glass window - almost open plan.

The menu is seasonal, with different tasting courses being available depending on time of the year, and produce availability. There is no choice of courses though, but that’s standard for a tasting menu.

Without spoiling the current tasting menu too much, the cod roe starter was incredibly moreish, the custard and roast chicken course was an amazing combination, and the sous vide wagyu steak… well, no words!

Whilst Folium doesn’t have a Michelin star (yet! Surely one must be coming?) it compares incredibly well to those restaurants in the area that do, and should be included in the same category.

Part 1:

📝: This restaurant/bar opened in Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham a couple years ago. Because my first visit was amazing and I couldn’t fault it, I decided to revisit. However, the  expectation second time round fell short.

The service on a whole was not good. After the waitress took the orders the menu’s were left on the table, empty glasses were also left on the table for the duration of the meal.

When I received my starter 2 hours later it was cold, I also had to wait around 45 minutes to receive drinks. However the cocktails were tasty and we were offered complimentary drinks for our wait.

🍴Starters
- £5.50 Spicy Chicken strips - coating had good flavour, I would order it again, but didn’t like the pepper sauce.

- £6.75 Fricassee chicken wings - balance of flavours was good , the depth of flavours was great you could taste everything you would want in a dish , the food definitely hit the mark.

- £6.75 Barbecue chicken wings - I liked the sweet taste of flavours, it melts in your mouth.

- £8 Jerk King prawns and Avocado salad - was tasty and flavoursome, cooked to perfection a really good dish

- £8 Coconut crisp prawns - They were nice and crispy but needed more coconut as I couldn’t really taste it, the peppered sauce was way too spicy didn’t really like it and it did not go well with the dish. I would of preferred a different sauce.

📝: part 2 - When I received my main course 3 hours later it was warm I was not impressed. I did feel like they struggled to cope with the pressure on Mother’s Day. I would not be in a rush to return as our experience this time round was not a good one. Considering it was Mother’s Day I was extremely disappointed.

🍴Mains
▪️£11.95 Veg curry - It was alright not bad, I would of pereferred potato and yam in the curry but it was just garden veg and peppers , seasoned rice needed a little bit more season as  it was very bland.

▪️£16.95 Peppered steak & white rice - Steak has a sweet taste not spicy , nice strong flavours, the rice was very fluffy And the veg was flavoursome

▪️ £22.95 Steak & rice n peas - my mom ordered the steak cooked medium rare , she was impressed with flavours of the dish especially the mushroom sauce which she thought was lovely and she enjoyed the cherry tomatoes was really tasty

▪️ £14.95 Fried chicken & rice n peas - Chicken & rice was dry needed gravy , food was also warm not hot enough . I would not order it again however the rice n peas was nice and fluffy, if it had gravy it would of gone down like a treat .

🍴Sides
▪️Dumplings  I wish they were cooked fresh as we did wait more than 2 hours for our food

▪️Mac n cheese - this was is nice not too creamy the consistency is  just right , the plantin was sweet but it was hard so not very enjoyable , I would of liked it more soft. Colsesaw I didn’t really like it didn’t give me the wow factor.

▪️£14.95 Bbq chicken & rice n peas - it was nice nothing special, i found it to be warm And I like my food hot with the steam coming off it.

The reason I’m only giving 4 stars for service is because we needed to prompt the girl who served us for side plates as we were sharing and cutlery after she cleared the table first time.

We was welcomed by a lovely young lady who gave us her divided attention which was very nice and appreciated.
The cocktails taste nice but less ice would have been appreciated
The starter of chicken wings was nice with a lovely sticky sauce.
We had the salmon for the mains with vegetables. The salmon was a very small portion and very little flavour and vegetables were bland and again no flavour.
I applaud the business but try to do a little more with the food as I would like you to prosper as I black restaurant and I will come again.
I hope to see you again soon.",2025-05-12 17:31:12,en

The food quality was outstanding—hot, fresh, and packed with flavor! The pizzas were perfectly baked with generous toppings, and the sides were just as delicious. Every bite was a delight, and I truly appreciate the consistency in taste and quality.

The staff were exceptionally friendly, making us feel welcomed and well taken care of. A special shout-out to Liby, who was particularly nice and attentive, enhancing our overall experience.

The biggest problem with large chain enterprise, within time the product and customer service fades away.

Toby Carvery is no exception. We have supported Denham Toby Carvery for around 2 years, and recently after experiencing poor food and appalling service, we have decided to void Toby Carvery.

All too often, staff training and customer service is left behind when a brand grows.

4 months ago, we were told by the staff that the Toby Rewards Scheme had changed to 1 stamp per table. Now reading through Toby Carvery T&Cs there were no change, in fact the T&Cs clearly state “every paying customer buying a main is welcome to collect rewards stamps.

So, for 4 months we debated with the staff and constantly being refused a stamp. We decided to take the matter to the head office via their online complains option; 3 online complaints were made and every complaint was ignored! (yet another sign of a company not caring about customers)

We went online and after 13 messages and 2 weeks of complaining we finally were told that “every paying customer whom buys a main is entitled to a stamp… Well, done Toby Carvery, you don’t need to tell me, you need to train you staff properly? To think that we needed to speak with a total of 7 staff before someone knew how the rewards program worked, that’s how appalling the training is.

When we asked about the stamps we are owned, the reply: “you need to provide your personal bank statements so we can see you have eaten at Toby Carvery” Seriously: who do Mitchells & Butlers think they are? We are not providing bank statements but you can go check your own app as that’s where we make our bookings. Again, serious lack of training.

I’ve worked in hospitality for over 25 years and would never ask a customer for their bank statement, especially for something that is Mitchells & Butlers fault. We should be thanked for bringing the matter to their attention, not penalised.

Having supported Toby Carvery for so many years, it’s a shame to see the organisation deteriorate so rapidly.

On our last visit: The food was well below average and we didn’t recognise any of the staff. Our waiter was on his 1st ever shift with no waitering experience and had limited knowledge. The poor lad really was struggling but the limited training he had was all wrong, He too, had been told 1 stamp per table… Can’t win.

The food was absolutely appalling. The beef was cheap fatty cut and not been cooked long enough. To say it was chewy would be an understatement. In fact, we could hear other tables complaining about the beef. The vegetables were over cooked and bland.  Their version a cheese sauce, was nothing more that cheese melted over cauliflower, with pumpkin slices!! More like hospital food than a restaurant. The pigs in blankets were an embarrassment, floating in oil absolutely disgusting. The entire meal was an embarrassment to the hospitality industry.

Once we experience the appalling behaviour from their head office, we knew it was time to leave Toby Carvery to their disgusting food, poor training and ridiculously informed staff on line and go elsewhere.

It is rare for me to write a poor review, but I don’t like being conned with misinformation, I don’t like untrained staff being left on their own, I don’t like below average food and I certainly do not like companies that ignore their customers. To ask a customer for their bank statement is unforgivable",2025-08-11 21:34:25,en

From start to finish, our experience was nothing short of exceptional. The food was absolutely delicious, and the customer service was truly first class – warm, attentive, and genuine.

We began with a generous serving of crispy *poppadoms*, accompanied by a delightful variety of chutneys and relishes – each sauce brought its own unique flavor, from tangy to sweet to spicy. A perfect way to whet the appetite.

For starters, we opted for the *Chicken Tikka* and *Papri Chaat*. The chicken was incredibly tender, marinated to perfection, and bursting with flavor. The papri chaat was a lovely mix of textures and tastes – crisp, creamy, tangy, and just the right amount of spice. Portion sizes were generous without being overwhelming.

Our mains included *Saag Chicken* and *Paneer Makhani*, served with freshly baked *Tandoori Roti*. Both dishes were outstanding – rich, flavorful, and well-balanced in spices. The saag chicken had a beautiful depth of flavor, while the paneer makhani was creamy and comforting, with a slight sweetness that paired beautifully with the spiced gravy. The medium spice level was spot on for us – just enough heat to excite the palate without overpowering the dish.

For dessert, we shared *Gulab Jamun with Ice Cream* alongside a cup of aromatic *Masala Chai*. The gulab jamun was warm, soft, and syrupy – complemented perfectly by the cool ice cream.

We’re regular diners at places like Dishoom, Asha’s, and Varanasi – and we can confidently say this restaurant holds its own among them. In fact, the level of customer service here may even surpass the others – the staff truly made us feel welcomed and valued.

Nepalese/Indian cuisine. We had the vegetarian platter, vegetarian momo and chicken momos for starters all very well presented and super tasty and perfectly spiced. For mains we had one of the chicken curries and Palak Paneer again perfectly spiced and flavourful. The cocktails I’ve got to say are high quality and better than cocktail bars around the city. They are unique and masterfully made. I’d go back just for the drinks. I also had Cobra beer on tap too. To finish we had the dessert platter. Very well presented but the Jalabi and Ras malai could have been a lot better. I’m Indian and know my Indian food well so I feel that most people who haven’t eaten these types of desserts in the past will love them from here.

The star of the show was our waitress. Truly an amazing member of the team. Lovely and polite manner and very funny too and an absolute delight. She made the evening so much better and have to say one of the best waitresses/waiters we’ve ever encountered. She haloed us choose the right things based on what we told her about our tastes.

If you think you’ve experienced the best Sunday roast, think again—because Rav and Jas at The Goat King have completely redefined the game. Their take on the classic roast, elevated with rich, flavorful saag, was nothing short of sublime. Every bite was a masterclass in balance, depth, and creativity. The meat was perfectly cooked, the saag was velvety and packed with warming spices, and the roast trimmings were spot-on.

The service matched the food—warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. Rav and Jas not only brought their culinary expertise to the table but also their passion and hospitality, making the experience feel both elevated and personal.

And the atmosphere? Effortlessly cool, with a buzz that made it feel like the place to be on a Sunday afternoon. Comforting, vibrant, and full of good energy—just like the food.

We both had the same starters and mains, as follows:

Starters"" Fritters of Desire"", consisting of Paneer, Feta , Halloumi, red onion, spinach, cauliflower, aubergine and potato tossed in masala mix fried in chickpea batter.

Ingredients were fresh and very tasty even if the portions were probably twice as large as needed!

Mains: The Goat King Special

Their signature dish, made of slow-cooked pulled goat curry served on and off the bone. Flavored with aromatic spices and herbs to enrich the meat and marrow to succulent perfection.

Served with rice and 2 soft, fluffy fritters, called  'Bhatura' which is a deep-fried leavened sourdough bread originating from the Indian subcontinent.

The goat was beautifully cooked and perfectly seasoned and was definitely some of the best meat I've eaten in any type of restaurant!

The light, rice infused Flying Buffalo Indian lager complimented the goat perfectly.

Rav, the owner/main chef and his wife are really friendly and Rav took time to sit with us & explain a bit about Sikh history and the importance of the food to their culture.

100% recommend The Goat King (also known as 24 Carrot Gold) for anyone wanting a change to their usual curry or mixed grills so popular in Birmingham's many Desi pubs!

First found the place after stepping out of the fine dining gaff next door. The smell of curry in the air had us like the Pied Piper, straight through the door and into what’s become one of my favourite places to eat.

It’s not flashy or trying to be something it’s not, just a proper family-run spot, the kind where you feel welcome the moment you walk in. No menus, no fuss, just whatever's bubbling away in the kitchen (and Rav's head!) that day. You sit down and dishes just start arriving, cooked fresh and full of depth.

I’ve been three times now. Twice with my mate and once with my family for my Fathers Day treat, and each visit has been different but equally memorable. The slow-cooked wild boar shoulder is unreal, but the goat curry is the real star for me—unctuous, rich, and perfect with rice and bread. I’ve not tried the veggie options, but everything else I’ve had has been banging.

You’ll see couples drop in for date night and families for dinner. Some pop in for something quick, fast Indian food and a drink, maybe a break mid-shop. But for me, it’s a place to settle in. We tend to stay for hours, let the small plates roll out, and soak it all up. With a solid wine list to compliment the food, lager sourced from India brewed from Basmati rice and rare Indian spirits to warm and lubricate the pipes.

What really makes it though, are the chats. Rav & Jas often come over for a sit and natter. Proper candid, Chatham House Rules-style conversations—you cover everything from food to life and whatever else floats by. It’s rare that a place feeds both your stomach and your head like this.

If you like real food, real people, and a space that just lets you be...get yourself here. (pictured- Slow roasted Wild Boar)

The second dish was so fresh and seasonal.

The cod was different. I like it more as a winter dish.

The BBQ mussels dish had lots going on. If you could just hook it straight to my veins.

Got a chance of trying their Kebab, £4.80 for a Mixed Kebab Wrap. Just like their Cheese Burger, nothing was special about the taste. Though the quality was average, the portion was huge so worth the price. If you are picky about Kebab, better avoid to save your curiosity. Otherwise, go ahead and it should be okay. Their Curry Sauce and Gravy are very good, even better with the Chips.

Tried some other items, so far the best ones for me are Fish and Pie. Their Cheese Burger is basically, a simple Cheese Burger. Bun, cheese, patty and that's it. Unless you really want a burger, do pick up some other items for your own sake. Trust me, the Pie and Chips deal is much better than the Cheese Burger and Chips deal. Ordered a Small Cod alone, still tasted good but as its name suggested it was really small considering the amount of crispy batter.

The focaccia was delicious, and the goats cheese / beetroot ravioli  was good, but the main pasta dishes were disappointing. I had the crab devon and my mum had the carasecce which in my opinion was undercooked. The crab Devon pasty was too fishy for me, and the carasecce was bland. The paparadelle had okay flavours , but nothing special. The dessert, was genuinely inedible, the poached rhubarb was still so hard, the nut praline didn’t have a great aftertaste and the sauce was very tart.

I’ve done both bottomless brunch and a regular dining visit and couldn’t recommend both enough!

Service is always excellent and attentive by staff. Carafes of water are regularly refilled and drinks take no time to come out at all.

The pasta is the real star here, though. Handmade on-site (seriously, if you walk past early enough you can see the magic happen!) and always tasty. I’ve only knocked off a star for food as last time I came my spaghetti was a bit on the undercooked side. Could have done with just one more minute or two to make it perfectly al dente!

I can honestly say the staff, atmosphere and new location is a lot better now that they have moved to the Jewellery Quarter.

Staff seem a lot more friendler and knowledgeable, and provide good customer service. And the atmosphere, location, and products on offer feel a lot better.

They have a good variety of card games, board games, t-shirts, and other merchandise to buy upstairs. Then downstairs is a free console playing area and free gaming tables for playing your own card and board games (though some tables maybe reserved for events). There is even a few free card and board games available for use downstairs too.

I didn't try the food at the old or new location, but from what I have seen they try and offer a good variety of snacks and quick food and drink to keep you going while gaming. If you want proper food or have special requirements - there are lots of pubs, restaurants, cafes etc nearby that may server better food if you want a proper meal beforehand.

I have visited twice. Once to look around and I got a nice Pokémon shirt. Then again to get a pre-release for MTG Wilds of Eldraine, some MTG commander decks, and a nice (now rare!) MTG LOTR playmat.

They have lots of other products though (especially themed around then events they hold).

There are lots of events and casual gaming sessions that look fun to join, and most paid  entry events seem to include a booster pack or a drink.

It is very convenient to have this shop in the Jewellery Quarter, as most geeky shops are in the City Centre or Digbeth. The Jewellery Quarter can be a nice alternative, as it a quieter space with nice architecture, so good for those who don't like crowds/busy areas.

The shop is easy to get to by train and tram (never tried it by bus).

If you get a Daytripper/Network Day Ticket from the bus/tram/train/train stations (it costs around £7.90 after 9:30 am - it includes a days unlimited travel by train, tram, and bus, around most of the West Midlands) you can easily have a look at this shop and other gaming shops in Birmingham to check stock and prices, and have fun around Brum.

My only suggestion to staff is that they need to open a window or put a few air fresheners downstairs, as there is not as much air flow downstairs as there is upstairs. As it is a cellar area, it just needs something to help it out when it gets a bit musty.",2023-09-15 08:04:13,en

Although the shop may cost a few pennies more, the coffee is better quality, better taste & is fresher.
My review:
Soon as you walk in Costa Coffees doors, it’s clean, pristine & pleasant smelling. It will either be almost empty or it’ll be where you can hardly find a seat - depending whether it’s peak times or not. Try to avoid going at peak times/rush hour (like when JQ offices/shops close for the day around 4-5pm). It has a warm, casual, calm vibe. Not like the City Centre chaos of ‘keep your handbag close’ type energy. Store is large, bright and welcoming. There’s usually 1-2 members of staff on so you’re served pretty quickly. (Ensure you scan your Costa Card & get those beans & free drinks!) Menu is high up and easily readable. Ask if you’re not sure/want something custom. It’s their job to assist you & you’re paying so don’t feel shy. Much more menu choices than the Express machines. Regular promotional items come & go (which I love) but they don’t last forever so get them quick! Usually a courteous manner from staff, prompt speed for serving you your drink, served without spillages, lid tight & my custom requests are honoured. Condiments area near to counter, it’s clean & well stocked with all items labelled clearly. This is usually where notices are regarding allergens, recycling info & store info; as well as the bin which I’ve never seen full or overflowing. Lots of seating but I chose to leave with my drinks every time. Big windows to view out of to see Frederick St (retail units, Car Paks complex, Chamberlain Clock & the mini roundabout it’s on) Parking is available right outside, 3-4 spots. This is free after 6pm to 8am & all Sunday, otherwise around £1.50. Pay at machine or RingGo app. Same nearby (Eg Warstone La & Vyse St). There’s Vyse St Multi Storey car park 2min walk away adj to the P.O. It’s technically the same road, just named different as it’s over the mini roundabout. Pricing is about the same & pay the same ways. Best to pay on the App as you can easily extend, not have to worry about finding change nor risk a ticket. I’ve never checked if there’s toilet facilities. I wouldn’t advise making reservations/pre ordering for collection unless it’s a very large order. You’re just going to get cold drinks. Although I’d say it’s kid friendly, it’s not a place for kids (it’s a place for coffee drinkers - which are 100% adults). So unless you have super young babies who just sleep 99% of the time in a pram/holster, very well behaved children or you’re only in for a collection therefore short periods eg - I wouldn’t advise bringing in kids. It’s a place that serves scolding hot liquids that customers set down on tables…. I don’t think you’d want your child/children running around that. Not the place. Pricing is much better than Starbucks by far, & slightly better than Tim Hortons. Prices are not as good as McD’s but DEFINITELY miles better than their quality. Service here meets Costa’s standards overall. I’ve seen better service for Costa in other locations but it’s not bad at all. Wheelchair/scooter friendly as no steps outside, it’s a flat ramp only. They also offer alternatives to dietary requirements. Giving 4/5 for service as I have been left waiting a few times when it’s been empty yet staff finish cleaning up/tending to coffee machines behind the counter/tables etc while I’m at the counter waiting to order. Nothing serious but after 2 minutes, it’s a little rude. Otherwise an excellent branch that no doubt sees 1000’s of customers per week in such a popular area like JQ. Yet still manages to maintain Google star rating of nearly 5. I will be returning to this branch. Recommended",2025-06-15 05:06:11,en

I recently visited **Demesecan Coffee House** and had a mixed experience. The staff were **friendly and welcoming**, which created a nice atmosphere. I ordered **saffron tea and toast**—the tea arrived quickly and was delicious, but the toast took **much longer** to come out.

When it finally arrived, it was just **plain toasted bread** with **separate butter cubes on the side**. The butter wasn’t even melted on the toast, which made it feel a bit **lazy and underwhelming**. For a place that seems cozy and well-run, I expected better—maybe **properly buttered and warmed toast** instead of having to do it myself.

**Pros:**
✔ Friendly staff
✔ Quick tea service
✔ Nice ambiance

**Cons:**
❌ Long wait for toast
❌ Unmelted butter served separately (felt cheap)
❌ Toast could have been prepared better

**Verdict:** A decent spot for drinks, but the food execution needs improvement. **3/5** for now—would return for the tea but maybe skip the toast.

Always passed by this restaurant thinking it's a toned down Indian restaurant serving tiny portions of Indian food, but oh boy, was I blown away.

I've attached my bill, I'd warn you though to get the prawns and lamb chops from the mains section instead of starters/appetisers if you're a party of 3 or more, perhaps a platter. Paneer flavour was amazing, my partner and I specially loved the prawns tandoori and lamb chops. Tender and juicy, well cooked, great use of ghee, just blown away. Shami kebab was alright.

Mains were insanely good, no jokes. The madras sea bream and king prawns biryani blew us away completely. Simple flavours yet seemingly so complex. Nothing overwhelming but really was a taste to behold. Get them without thinking again.

Absolutely lovely hospitality, didn't get the names but we were very well looked after. Great staff. Will definitely come again.

Alas, all good reviews have to come to a bad end. Pina colada was a bit of a let down but not really disappointing. Its just the way I am. I'm extremely critical of my PC's. Sorry to mention but you can probably pop into L*s-Igu*nas next door for it with a 1+1 offer.",2025-04-27 01:38:58,en

Got two things on the house- as we entered and as we finished. I had the donner gyro which was really nice and fresh and warm. My friend had the mixed grill which they enjoyed tasted the best when the lemon was drizzled all over it for the added moisture. Service was amazing there. Notably, Jerusalem was an absolute star, super friendly immediately as you walk in, makes sure you’re comfortable, offers exceptional customer service and all in all a lovely beautiful member of staff, she really made it such a pleasurable service.

In the past, the Bavarian night had a full band performing, creating a lively and fun atmosphere. However, this time, there was just one man (who did his best to be a good host) and one woman, who didn't really add much. As mentioned, the host really was trying and he was fairly funny, but overall it was just a bit “meh”.

At £20 per person, we were expecting a more engaging experience, but it felt lacking in comparison to previous visits. The energy just wasn't there, and despite the host's efforts, it didn't live up to the excitement we were hoping for.

I’m a regular customer at this store, and I’ve noticed this happening more than once. I also have experience in the food industry, so I understand the importance of proper management. Some managers only care about getting bonuses👎 and don’t pay attention to the staff or service quality.

The service felt fast with multiple options and extras; e.g. guacamole for £1.30, but the servers were fine and didn't hassle us when we asked questions or declined paying any extra.

The beans looked like they had been sat for a long time, tide mark around the container, but tasted fine.  I had a burrito and the main content is rice, with a small scoop of your chosen main. Cheese and various salsas as well as beans were included. No additional salad, so pretty traditional. You could pay extra for sour cream and guacamole.  A small tub, slightly larger than a McDonald's self serve sauce pot was the size. The guacamole tasted good with no brown bits to it and we saw the team making it fresh.

Tables were small with small chairs which had low backs for some reason. Bench and banqueting seating was also available.

Wooden forks were available. I also think metal knives were available, but they looked dirty so I did not bother with those.

The three tacos were very small, so ideal for a light snack. Add fries or other extras if you are after more of a lunch.",2025-08-05 14:51:13,en

While the the service was reasonably quick despite a busy period, that was the only positive note. The main letdown was the Lavender Matcha Oat Latte. It looked off from the start — nothing like how it’s marketed, lacking the signature vibrant green and lavender tones. In terms of taste, it was even worse: overly milky with barely any presence of matcha or lavender syrup. These are supposed to be the core ingredients of the drink, yet they were either added in negligible amounts or of such poor quality they failed to register, especially the matcha. The drink was bland, diluted, and uninspiring.

The only saving grace in my meal was the Steak Sandwich, which I did enjoy nonetheless. But unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to redeem the experience. Considering the premium prices, I expected consistency and quality. Instead I received a subpar beverage and overall disappointing order. This visit reflect a lack of quality control and poor attention to the brand’s usual standards.

They told me at the POS that they do not accept the Starbucks app, which meant I did not get 30% off and had to pay £6.95, which is about £2.00 more than at other stores. I agreed and paid for my order.

At that price, I was at least expecting my order to be correct. The order was passed on to a partner called Bertrik who made my order with ordinary milk, I did ask if it was made with Oat milknandnhe confirmed it was. I did ask for cream; however, he put the cream on the inside of the lid and not on the actual drink. I have never seen that before, so that shocked me. The drink was spilling over the edge of the cup when he finished, and he just passed it to me in a mess, which I had to wipe and clean.

I noticed straight away that before he put the lid on, the top of the drink was pure white. With oat milk, you get a yellow color on top, not white. Also, when I started to drink it, there was no oat milk taste at all, which again is not normal.

I took about three sips and stopped drinking it. I had to go to catch my coach but overall felt like I had been ripped off.

After about 15 minutes, my stomach started to ache as I am lactose intolerant, I can only have a little lactose before it starta hurting my stomach.

Also, on my visit, cross-contamination was witnessed. Bertrik made a frappuccino with a blender that previously had cookies and cream in it and did not wash it before use. My thought at that time was, ""If he is doing this, then he must be doing this with all the pitchers too."" This is a huge concern, imagining that my drink was made in a picter that had not been washed all morning was not a lovely picture in my head.

I hope you take this seriously. I have attached a photo of my Grande white mocha in this email.

Also No name on cup! No thank you on hand off.

Also did not ask for XH!",2025-04-27 10:21:08,en

It was absolutely crowded out, and I discovered why afterwards. They had a deal on for a free kids meal if you spend £10 or more. I hadn't seen this so I paid full price, which is my own mistake! It's a cashless venue, and you have to order off the QR code, or at least that's what I was told to do anyway.

I was very happy with the buffet as all of it was non-haallal so all options were fine for me. A decent selection of pizza varieties, my personal favourite was the 'nduja one. They do serve beer and wine but I stuck to the soft drink machine as it was included in the buffet. All of the staff were lovely, it's just how busy the place was and the queues where quite overwhelming, as well as lots of little kids running freely and popping up over our booth.

No complaints about the quality of the food, which was made to a high standard. However, a member of staff clearly told me that I could order select items like gyoza, katsu curry etc off the menu as part of the bottomless belt.

Unfortunately, when I came to order these items, another member of staff apologised and said the policy had changed, and I would only have the cold options on the belt. This left me disappointed, as I wouldn’t have the same experience I could’ve had months earlier. In addition the belt options were basically variations of the same thing. Salmon on rice (nigiri), salmon in rice (futomaki) or salmon on its own (sashimi). I saw Edamame once (I managed to nab it), and waited almost an hour for desserts to roll out.

When it came to settling my bill, I was almost overcharged by £10 on the service fee, something I was not made aware of beforehand either online or in person. When I politely contested the charge, it was edited before my eyes to £2.25. Even this amount was too much, as I only wished to pay £29.95. Considering the mistakes made, I did not believe a service charge was warranted.

All in all, this experience has dissuaded me from bringing my family here in the future, and I hope you can look into some of these issues as it may hinder return visits.",2025-07-25 01:03:27,en

That said, the food itself didn’t quite hit the mark for me. The dishes looked good, but were missing a bit of flavour – just felt like they needed a bit more seasoning or something to bring them to life. I’ve definitely had better meals elsewhere in Birmingham.

Still, it’s not a bad spot if you’re nearby and need a bite – clean, convenient, and decent value. I’d give it 4 stars overall, mostly for the service and price.",2025-04-13 21:44:10,en

Placed my order, asking if they had skimmed milk, and was told only semi-skimmed. OK, that was fine.  The server went on to make my drink, making a big show of going into the fridge for said semi-milk.   It was obvious they had none.  She then proceeded to use the full-fat milk on the side.   I pulled her up on this, she totally denied it, although I had seen it with my own eyes.    She then admitted it, telling me she had too much on her mind etc.   She did remake the drink using oat milk, promptly spilling it on the counter and on me.   This was no biggie, I guess, well, not for me,  I just prefer skimmed milk, but as I pointed out to the server, what if this had been a medical dietary need ?? An allergy situation, and she was substituting items, which could have been a dangerous situation.    She couldn't seem to grasp that people could have issues with items being substituted without them knowing what they were getting. I know this sounds petty over milk, but if you're serving food, drinks, etc, if the customer asks for a certain thing, don't lie.

The cafe was very busy but we didn’t have to wait long to get a table, we ordered a Yorks House Breakfast which was so delicious, Fried chicken & French Toast with a beautiful sauce on the side and the Masala fries which were very tasty. Staff was really lovely and friendly.
Also great coffee selection and perfect atmosphere for a Café.
We went back again for more coffee and Avocado smashed and Feta cheeses on Toast, so yummy!

Popped in for a coffee as it says coffee house on the front sign. Ordered a flat white at £3.30, a bit cheaper than most indy places and the menu looked reasonable and well priced but I just wanted some coffee. Ordered a flat white and served quickly but the cup was HOT, I then went to add some sweetener and when I took the lid off the milk was way too frothy for a flat white (or even for a cappuccino). I waited 5-10 mins for it to get to a drinkable temperature and it just tasted burnt. Both the espresso and the milk and the texture wasn't what I'd expect at all. Similar milk texture to a Greggs flat white but at least Greggs espresso isn't burnt.

I binned the entire coffee which I hate doing. I'll always try and force myself to drink something I've paid for but it was just bitter. Got a coffee at another nearby spot and there was a world of difference in the care for the process and the final drink.

For the oreo tiramisu and hojicha cream roll, I was expecting a creamy and smooth texture. But the tiramisu was solid hard like frozen cheesecake. Even the cream roll, the sponge cake wasn’t soft enough. The cream was very thick and not airy as I expected.

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly throughout our stay, particularly the restaurant team — their level of service was second to none and they really went out of their way to assist.

The room was comfortable and the location is ideal — just a 15-minute walk to New Street Station and the Bullring, with the Mailbox and central Birmingham attractions only a few minutes away on foot. The hotel itself is well maintained and clean, making for a pleasant base during our visit.

The only downside, and the reason for not giving a full five stars, was the lack of air conditioning. The room was uncomfortably warm and I struggled to get a good night’s sleep due to the heat. If this issue were resolved, it would be a near-perfect stay.

As an example, the waitress dropped cutlery on the table whilst rushing to clear our plates and splashed my hair and dress with curry, but didn't seem very apologetic, only mumbled something about a wipe which I didn't understand - just wanted to leave at that point.
Overall, not sure if I'd come back. The place looks a bit dated and rundown (some seats were dirty, menu pages had folds and stains), not worth the money. For a dinner for 4 paid £150, so better off finding a local curry house.
✏️Update - had a call from management today about the review, seemed very apologetic, passionate about providing great customer experience and keen to make up for the other evening.

I was a little uncertain given the odd review mentioning service problems with smaller groups. We were a table of 4 . My fears were quickly dispelled by a really good and well organised front of house team. We particularly liked Victoria’s attentive and charismatic charm throughout the evening.

This was our first visit to Bank and we’re delighted with the menu. Really good starters in fact they were exceptional. Fish was tasty and beautifully cooked. We all enjoyed the cocktails and the setting over the canal was lovely.

Personally I do think the meals are good value give the quality of the produce the presentation and location.

We will have to return if we are in the area again but will have to try the other restaurants within the chain when possible.

Our server on the terrace was Renee, she was a whole vibe! Absolutely loved her, it was honestly like talking to a friend from start to finish. I know that is part of her job, but it wasn’t like being served normally - it was like being out with the girls, but she was still professional of course! We didn’t wait too long for anything, and when one of the drinks did take a little longer she came over and let us know which was nice.

We arrived a little early but were able to wait in the bar area until our table was ready. Our friendly server took us to our table and gave us plenty of time to browse the menu before ordering. Everything was incredibly clean and tidy. My partner and I both went for the veal, which was cooked perfectly. For dessert we tried the burnt Basque cheesecake, a favourite of ours and it didn't disappoint!

It was incredibly busy on the Sunday evening we visited, and the wait was around 30 minutes for our food. We thought this was acceptable given how busy they were.

As already mentioned, it's expensive here but well worth it for a special occasion. The bill includes an optional service charge, and speaking to our server we learned it does go to them and not the management and we were happy to pay it - the service really is very good.

(This is the second time I've reserved an area for one of my events but I have yet to try the food!)

A few things that to note for potential improvement.

1. The type of music from the DJ is the type of music you get in a gym when you workout. It would be such a better atmosphere to have Pop/Rnb/Hip-Hop/Ol' Skool - that would truly lend a hand to making the vibe so much more enjoyable as well as having a DJ who knows how to work and interact with a crowd. (This coming from a radio presenter and event host of over 25 years experience.)
2. The music is a bit too loud and makes speaking to people more difficult. When you have a function you want to be able to talk rather than shout at people.

That's my only two bits of feedback.",2025-07-21 11:19:49,en

Skipped the Mother's Day menu (£45 for 2 courses / £50 for three) and went a la carte. Great choice of dishes and drinks. Grill menu is excellent. Negatives: didn't get one of 3 Korean Chicken starters so 3 of us ate the starter and then 10min later the 4th came over. There should have been a goodwill gesture from the restaurant but there wasn't. We spent £60 a head on average so it's a bit of a miss by the establishment.

Atmosphere:
Rooftop restaurant, atmosphere is nice and good songs played throughout the dinner. View is pleasant but charged £5 per person for a window seat (came to an extra £10). There is a bar section that plays different songs but this does not interfere with the dining area, seems to be quite lively with people even dancing. There is a smoking area that provides an amazing view too.

Food:
Halal steaks are available if you require this but it is only the fillets. Do not order the calamari below, it is extremely chewy, the batter is stale, the sauce has a weird test (I would rate this 0/10). Steaks are nicely cooked and the peppercorn sauce is good too, mushrooms had a bitter taste, spinach is okay but not reasoned well. Ordered a side of chips and onion rings to share, onion rings are huge and I ordinarily like this style but they were extremely oily, to the point it becomes uncomfortable to eat. Chips were thick cut but also very oily, I would not recommend either of the sides. The only nice thing ordered was the steak.

Service:
Service was professional but we had to call someone over to order which usually does not happen as waiters come over. We also had to wait a while to pay once the bill was received. Other than that the waiters were very nice.",2025-05-31 23:57:32,en

It gets worst they gave me cold,old ,eaten food the wing on the breast look eaten and i think it was done intentionally because I requested two legs .

I ordered peri tamer and you can’t even taste it tasted like plainish .

I spent over £20 for eaten food plus there was no tissue ,sauce or cutlery in the bag .

He went over to the bouncers and then they came over and asked him for a word.. he walked over to the door with them for a word and they grabbed him. 3 on 1.. dragged him to the floor like a rag doll.. and in that when he got up they were backing down as he was ready to start.. which at this point everyone from the table had gone over as we knew it was bang out of order… It’s disgusting how you could treat people like that and for what reason.. he had done nothing wrong whatsoever.. the 1 bouncer apologized to us and he said he didn’t know what had happened and he would try and sort it.

I visited this station on 20/04/2025 around 4:50 PM, filled up with £39.89 of fuel, and purchased a pint of milk and baby wipes, paying £42.40 in full through the service window (as the shop was closed).

Despite this, I later received a letter from a third-party company (ForecourtEye) claiming I had stolen fuel — an accusation based solely on the word of the garage manager. I have provided bank statements proving I paid the full amount, yet they continue to pursue me, refusing to supply any receipt, CCTV or breakdown of what was sold.

To make things worse, they’re claiming I purchased AdBlue, which is impossible — I drive a petrol Vauxhall Corsa, which doesn’t use it!

This experience has been stressful, damaging, and completely unfair. It reflects very poorly on how this forecourt is run, and I hope Shell and others take action to prevent this from happening to other innocent customers.

They said their priority was petrol sales, and only afterward would they assist with Amazon services.

This is disappointing, as it creates confusion and poor customer service for Amazon users. If the petrol station cannot handle Amazon services effectively, they shouldn’t partner with Amazon. I waited for several minutes while multiple customers were served, and eventually, I got fed up and left without my parcel.

Dear Subway Management,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my disappointment regarding a recent experience at your Edgbaston location. During an emergency, I urgently needed access to the restroom. However, I was informed by your staff that I would first need to make a purchase in order to gain permission.

As a regular customer of Subway, I found this policy quite disheartening, especially during a time of genuine need. This experience has left me feeling undervalued as a loyal customer, and I am now considering boycotting Subway altogether.

I believe that customer service should prioritize the well-being of patrons, especially in emergency situations. I hope that you can address this matter and ensure that future customers do not face similar challenges.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Dear Subway Team,

I am writing to share my recent experience at your store on 7th July around 8:00 PM. The store was quiet at the time, with only two or three other customers present. My wife and I had initially planned to dine in. While she was seated, a staff member wearing a black uniform approached us and asked her to change her seat in a very rude and unprofessional manner.

We found this behavior extremely disappointing and chose to leave and dine elsewhere. I still decided to use my Subway points to purchase water bottles, but the same staff member refused this as well, which added to our frustration.

I believe the individual in the black uniform might be the manager. If that is the case, I am genuinely concerned about how someone with such poor customer service skills is leading the team. Respectful and courteous behavior should be a priority, especially from management.

I hope this feedback is taken seriously, and the staff member is advised to treat customers with basic respect and professionalism in the future.

Thank you for your time and understanding.",2025-07-10 13:35:20,en

A male staff member acknowledged me with a nod, but no one ever came to take my order. I waited patiently for 10 minutes, yet still, no one approached.

Thinking perhaps the restaurant required online ordering, I tried placing an order via your online system. However, I received an error message saying that this table number was not recognized by the system. This was incredibly frustrating and unacceptable.

The service was so poor that I couldn’t tolerate it any longer. It was beyond disappointing—it was outright infuriating.

We waited 25 minutes to be sat down and whilst waiting nobody spoke to us. We were a reserved table of 6 and the waitress ROSIE clearly didn’t care about her job, she was rude and senseless to us.

When we were FINALLY sat down we were placed at a table for 4!!!! Whilst there was an empty table for 6 with nobody sat at it. ROSIE then proceeded to place a couple and a table for four at said table for 6.

This really upset us as ROSIE didn’t even apologise to us and when we asked for another table she simply walked off.

When we spoke to LAUREN the manager we were then told that the couple that were sat AFTER us at said table for 6 were regulars and neither LAUREN or ROSIE apologised to us.

In fact ROSIE persisted to seat other people at 6 seater tables purely out of pettiness until we decided to move ourselves to one.

Nobody came and asked us how our food was and apart from AMRIT who seemed much more with it and helpful, we were treated with cold responses.

I personally don’t see how one cannot count to 6. However, be that as it may, the service that we were given was the worst customer service I have EVER received.

Staff were friendly, attentive and helpful and I can't fault them.

Order needs to be placed via a tablet on your table. I'm not a big fan of this concept but went with it. I found it quite difficult to order what I had seen on the menu as the two didn't appear to match completely, but that could have been down to my use of the app. Another issue I have with the Tablet order and pay system is I have to instantly decide on my level of tip ... Before I have even seen my food or had a complete service. This seems a bit silly to me.

Food came and the fries were fabulous. I can't help but be disappointed by the chicken burger and onion rings. Burger was very small for the price and was essentially a piece of fried chicken breast, with some over chewy and crispy areas. Onion rings were hard and too crispy and some of the onion was a bit rough.

I had a coke with my meal, the choice of alcoholic drinks was very limited, I think there was only Cruz Campo available (wouldn't swear to this).

Overall for a meal which cost me £31.19 including a service charge of 12.5%, other than the excellent fries I would probably prefer a chicken burger from McDonald's or Burger King. This could be just down to personal preference, but I am giving an honest appraisal of my meal and experience here.

Most of the food spots around this area seem to be chains, and I could not find any smaller independent places, which I usually prefer to support.

That said, this chain actually surprised me with the quality of the food. It was much better than I expected. The service, however, was nothing special. I was not a fan of the tablet-based ordering system, especially as we had major issues when it came to paying.

I would return to a GBK, but only if the food is consistent across other branches, as I was genuinely happy with the meal. The downside is the price. For a chain restaurant, it felt quite expensive, and to be honest, not entirely worth it. While some of the food is cooked fresh to order, it still feels quite standardised, and you do get the sense that not everything is made from scratch in the branch. The service also did not really add much to the experience.

At that price point, I would usually expect to be supporting a smaller independent burger place where more care goes into the food and where the chefs likely have a bit more skill and flexibility in how things are prepared.",2025-07-06 22:47:30,en

I anticipated we may be slightly late so emailed to ask if we could move the brunch forward 30 minutes however no one responded.

We managed to arrive at our original time and drink and food orders were taken promptly. The food was nice and the variety of drinks kept everyone happy. Service was prompt.

Our brunch was due to finish at 3.30pm so the waitress came over at 3pm and said the brunch is finishing soon so can I get you some more drinks then I'll take your final order after that. Throughout the brunch we had been finishing our drinks in around 5-7 minutes. The waitress arrived at 3.15pm with our last drinks then promptly took payment for the brunch. We still had 15 minutes left of our 90 minutes, which we believed we could have easily had one more order. I have been to most of the bottomless brunches in Birmingham and also other places in the UK and usually the last order is taken at the end of the brunch.

When we questioned this, we were advised that our time started from when we started drinking, so my friend stated that we placed our drinks order at 2pm and didn't start drinking til after 2pm if that was the policy and the waitress said ""well I took your order at 2pm."" The argument we had was that we still had 15 minutes left of our brunch and they were taking our payment trying to get us off the table before the 90 minutes was up.

I feel we had a completely valid point and something that I have never come across at any other bottomless and that we asked politely, yet we were met with attitude from the waitress. Everything up until this point was great.

My recommendation would be that if you want to go to a bottomless brunch where you are actually given the whole 90 minutes as promised on the t&c's then to attend elsewhere!",2025-06-01 22:44:12,en

They have expressed to me multiple times how enjoyable deejay made the entire experience. He really understood how to maintain and enhance the vibes and was also very respectful to my elders which I really appreciated, but also adapted his energy to myself and my younger cousin who had recently graduated.

Overall fantastic experience. Couldn't fault the wait times for seating, drinks or food. The staff were reasonably attentive without going overboard. My jerk salmon pasta slapped as did my 2-4-1 Mango Spice cocktail. Deejay you done convinced mom to return for another pina colada, she's your problem now 🤣

Title: Deeply Disappointed – Would Not Recommend

We were genuinely excited to host our wedding here, but the experience fell far short of expectations. The air conditioning in both the venue and rooms was completely inadequate — the unit was visibly dirty, leaking, and not cooling the space, causing our £600 wedding cake to collapse by the evening. This was especially frustrating as we had been told it would be fine if the room was climate-controlled — which it clearly wasn’t.

There was no proper duty manager after 7 PM despite prior assurances. When issues came up later in the evening — such as missing food allergy labels — there was no one clearly in charge to handle it.

The hotel stay was also a nightmare. We had to get our room keys sorted six times, staff seemed unaware of our bookings, and the room aircon didn’t work, forcing us to leave the balcony door open all night. Since our wedding, we’ve seen similar reviews which confirms these are recurring problems.

After the event, we raised all these issues and asked to escalate the complaint. Our request was ignored, and the response we received was dismissive.

A wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime occasion — and we left feeling let down, stressed, and incredibly disappointed. Based on our experience, we would not recommend this venue to future couples.",2025-06-21 13:44:57,en

POOR SERVICE!!
POOR ROOM CONDITIONS!!

I stayed at this hotel for my wedding, expecting a comfortable and enjoyable experience, but unfortunately, I was met with poor service.
Raising complaints will be a waste of time because they will not follow up with you.

* Room Conditions: The room was extremely hot and uncomfortable. I had no option but to sleep with the balcony door open, which made the room very noisy throughout the night, affecting my ability to rest.
* Poor Room Maintenance: The curtains in the room were falling apart, contributing to a substandard experience that was far below what I anticipated.
* Check-in Problems: Upon arrival, I was given the wrong key card and had to check in again to resolve the issue.
* Access Issues and Poor Customer Service: My sister’s key card stopped working at around 9 PM. She attempted to find staff at reception on six separate occasions, and nobody was available until much later. When someone was finally located, she was issued a new key but was then told that no one should be staying in the room – despite the room having been paid for. This left her confused and concerned.

Very disappointed and would not recommend. If I knew that this was gonna be the case i would have 💯 chose a different hotel for my wedding.",2025-06-25 08:02:01,en

We had a highly disappointing experience at The Cube Hotel. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that this was not going to live up to its advertised standards. The reception staff were completely unresponsive — calls went unanswered repeatedly, making it impossible to get any assistance when needed.

The room was another letdown. The air conditioning was broken, and with no windows to open for fresh air, the space quickly became uncomfortable and stifling. For the high price paid, we expected at least the basics to function properly.

This hotel does not even come close to a 4-star standard. In fact, we’ve stayed in far better hotels across Africa that offered outstanding service and comfort at a fraction of the price.

Overall, The Cube Hotel was a complete disaster. I would not recommend it to anyone.",2025-05-17 16:08:42,en

A special thank you to Matthew and Azhar (apologies if I’ve misspelled your name!) who welcomed us so kindly at check-in—their hospitality set the tone for a truly memorable stay.

We were surprised with complimentary drinks and thoughtful extras, which added a personal and celebratory touch. The hotel itself was elegant, modern, and spotless. The lounge and bar area was spacious and beautifully designed, with a lovely outdoor view that made it perfect for relaxing.

One detail I especially appreciated was the fresh floral scent throughout the hotel—no unpleasant odours, just subtle notes that greeted us in lifts and corridors. It’s a small thing, but it speaks volumes about the care and attention to detail.

The staff were consistently attentive and accommodating, and the secure parking nearby made everything easy. Though we’re not from Birmingham, we explored Bullring, just a 20-minute walk or 5-minute drive away. The location is ideal for anyone wanting to enjoy the city’s buzz while staying somewhere peaceful and refined.

In short, Park Regis Birmingham offers the perfect blend of style, comfort, and heartfelt hospitality. Highly recommended.

Thank you.",2025-08-12 14:02:50,en

Subway is my go-to spot when I want something quick, tasty, and made exactly how I like it. The ingredients are always fresh, especially the veggies, and I love how many choices I have—from the bread to the sauces. The staff is usually friendly and efficient, even during busy hours.

My favorite is the Chicken Teriyaki or the Veggie Delight with extra cheese and chipotle southwest sauce—highly recommend it toasted! It’s also a great option if you’re trying to eat a bit healthier without sacrificing flavor.

We order for home delivery from Domino's often as one of the kids won't even try other restaurants. The ordering remains a very frustrating experience - there are so many deals, which really are not deals as no one would buy these 'full price' without the deals. The deals are confusing and  unlike other chains the best deal is not automatically applied. Would you believe that two small portions of side are cheaper than one 'standard portion'? The portion size of the sides are small, considering the price. The toppings are getting smaller over the years. The food sometimes arrive lukewarm.

Where breakfast meets bargain and the pints flow freer than the traffic outside.

Dropped into the Figure of Eight on a brisk Birmingham morning—Broad Street still yawning from the night before—for a no-fuss traditional breakfast. Verdict? Somewhere between average and actually-not-bad-at-all. But here’s the thing: for the price, it was more than adequate—it’s Wetherspoons, not The Ritz.

You know the drill: sausage, egg, beans, toast, and hash browns that could stop a hangover in its tracks. The coffee? Bottomless. Refill ’til your soul stops screaming. It’s a JD institution, like sticky menus and gents debating politics at 10am.

Now, let’s talk booze. Cheapest in the land. You could build a pyramid of pints for the price of a single cocktail elsewhere. And there’s something comforting about that classic Spoons setup—wooden booths, sticky floors, and a drinks menu as thick as a Dickens novel.

In summary:
Not a culinary pilgrimage, but for a breakfast with caffeine on tap and change left over for a cheeky morning lager, the Figure of Eight does exactly what it says on the tin. And then some.

Rating: 7/10 – mostly for the price, the bottomless brew, and the familiar Spoons charm.",2025-07-07 11:08:16,en

We had hot chocolates and they were fantastic.

Some other customers with a young child got up and left a right mess on their table and floor and just walked out !!  (which I find appalling, they must live in a dustbin to think that's acceptable in any Society) I tried to hint about the mess they were leaving as they were dusting broken crisps off their child into the floor and table but it just bounced off them... If it was my shop I'd have given them a broom before they left !!

The young lady who was on duty just took it in her stride to clean up after these vagrants.

After a short time I noticed this same young lady go outside where a small female child had accidentally dropped her drink and was looking quite upset...

She helped clean up the mess and then made the girl another drink...

Definitely above and beyond from this Costa team member and the drink was great too. 🙂",2022-04-19 15:13:10,en

The moment you step in, it feels like a treat—modern design, clean spaces, and an inviting atmosphere. The real magic happens inside the screens, though. Every seat is a luxurious recliner with plenty of legroom, so you can fully relax while watching. The sound and visuals are incredible—crisp and immersive, perfect for films like Moana 2. It's a great place for families, couples, or even solo movie nights. Plus, their snacks and drinks selection is solid, from classic popcorn to more premium options.

However, the snack and food service is horrible. The team struggle with orders, people are waiting over half an hour for their food and snacks. It’s a shame for such a great cinema, they definitely need to change the way they prepare food and the order system. Visited again today and the whole service was crazy, people were kicking off with the staff, swearing and getting aggressive, the staff didn’t seem to care. Orders were getting mixed up and the staff seemed to crumble under pressure. I would probably recommend how cinema orders used to be here, singular queue with multiple tills open and doing an order at a time instead of trying to do multiple orders in one go and getting confused what order they were on which was happening today. Hopefully you guys can take the feedback and change this as it is my go to cinema but will check out other options in the future.",2025-08-12 01:14:51,en

The cafe is situated within a university campus (I think), so the typical clientel I assume are students and lecturers. It is tucked away from busy areas in Birmingham so I don't think the general public tend to visit this cafe, although it is open to all.

I took a star off because the tandoori chicken itself was of poor quality; it came in small cubes which did not look like chicken at all, and I didn't really taste the tandoori flavour.

The Moseley Arms offers a practical and generally pleasant experience for a city centre stay in Birmingham, earning a solid 3 out of 5 from my visit. It's a good choice if you prioritize convenience and a lively atmosphere over luxury, but it does come with a few caveats.
The Good:
* Location is King: Without a doubt, the prime advantage of The Moseley Arms is its location. Nestled in Digbeth, it's incredibly close to major transport links like Moor Street and Grand Central stations, making arrival and departure a breeze. For those heading to the Custard Factory or O2 Institute, or simply wanting to explore the Bullring, it's perfectly situated for easy access. The free on-site parking is also a significant bonus in such a central area.
* Friendly Faces: The staff deserve a special mention. They were consistently welcoming, helpful, and efficient, contributing significantly to a positive overall impression. Service at the bar and check-in/out was always prompt and friendly.
* Pub Vibe: If you appreciate a traditional pub atmosphere, you'll feel right at home. The bar area is lively, offering a good selection of drinks. We didn't sample the full food menu beyond some snacks, but the general buzz was enjoyable.
The Alright (and what holds it back from a higher score):
* Room Comfort (Just About): Our room was clean and had the essentials – an en-suite, TV, and tea/coffee facilities. However, it was fairly basic. While perfectly adequate for a short stay, the general wear and tear were noticeable, and a refresh wouldn't go amiss. We also found the sound insulation to be a bit lacking, meaning we could hear some of the pub's activity and fellow guests, though it wasn't overly disruptive during our midweek stay.
* Breakfast (Average): We opted for breakfast, which was convenient but fairly standard fare. Nothing to write home about, but it filled a gap before a day of exploring. It's an additional cost, and while not unreasonable, it didn't feel like particularly good value for what was offered.
* Noise Potential: While we didn't experience excessive noise, it's clear that on a weekend, with live entertainment running, this could be an issue for light sleepers. During our stay, the general pub chatter was audible but not intrusive.
The Verdict:
The Moseley Arms is a perfectly decent option for a short, functional stay in Birmingham, especially if you're attending an event nearby or just passing through. Its fantastic location and genuinely friendly staff are its strongest assets. However, don't expect a luxurious or particularly quiet retreat. It does what it says on the tin – a convenient city pub with rooms – and for that, it earns a solid 4 out of 5.",2025-07-15 09:38:15,en

It provided everything we needed for a short stay. Staff were friendly and attentive to our needs. The price reflects it's location which is on the periphery of the city centre and appears rather run down. but is in the process of transition. It is about a 20 minute walk to the City Centre and main attractions.
The pub provides meals which we did not try and sadly breakfast is only served on a Sunday.

A huge selling point for me, as a pescatarian, is that I can choose any burger on the menu and simply swap the beef for a vegan patty, no awkward menu limitations here! The loaded fries are next-level; the flavours absolutely explode in your mouth. I’d love the portion size to be slightly bigger, but they’re so generous with the sauce and toppings that you can’t really complain.

The drinks are delicious, refreshing, and reasonably priced, always a bonus.

The manager made a genuine effort to check in with customers, which we appreciated. However, the gentleman who took our order seemed a little off that evening. At one point, we were told our water bottle might be “confiscated,” which came across quite harshly especially as one of us carries water for medical reasons.

Onto the 3rd and final lounge on my Birmingham tour, ended up at Le Mirage. Upon entering we were asked to take a seat anywhere we liked so we decided to seat in these booth style sofa right at the end, seating was comfortable. Decided to order something we haven’t tried before so green ice pops it was. Shisha came out within 10 minutes in a old school ice chamber pipe, might be a KM but unsure we were also given disposable pipes. Shisha was good but the flavour died down within 30-40 minutes and this was because of the Egyptian head they use I tend to find these types of bowls give off a more harsher smoke. Lounge was big in size with plenty of seating. Price since you are in Birmingham is pretty decent and cards are accepted. Parking is a bit difficult as the roads have parking restrictions but if there’s a space on the pavement you just dump your car there. Vibe was good it was getting busier just as we were leaving. Overall a decent lounge to visit with hot food and desserts also served.",2020-07-26 15:05:03,en

It's very attractive to visit.Excellent location for the hippodrome theatre.
They certainly coped with a busy pre theatre lunch session.Limited menu.
Staff were helpful,at times we felt at little over stretched.
Food,in the main all good.Little touches would have raised the bar.
The sea bass was very good,but had been dried out around the edges,from the pass,which given it was busy was odd.
Lasagna,good,but lacking that crispy finish.Not exceptional.
Everything arrived hot.
Calamari,good, little rubbery.
Things like putting olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the tables would be a nice touch.
Mains came with a salad
The desert's we had were excellent  have to say,my lemon based one,one of the best I eaten.
Tap water provided no problem.
Wines, delicious whites well chilled.
Price point above average to high for the quality.
But overall a lovely lunchtime experience.
Thank you.

My order number was 1070, placed around 5:16 PM. Before I could even order, I waited at the counter for five minutes. When I politely inquired if orders were taken there, a staff member responded with shocking rudeness. She snapped, 'Do you not know how to use a kiosk?' making me feel incredibly foolish.

I explained that the last time I used a kiosk, it didn't accept cash. Instead of assisting, she barked several things at me, refused to take my order, when i stuck up for myself. and warned, 'Don't get me mad!' I was appalled by her aggressive tone, especially since I had done nothing wrong. It felt as though she was taking out her frustrations on me, which is completely unacceptable. I've worked in fast food myself and never treated a customer with such disrespect.

Her behavior made me feel violated. Had I not really wanted KFC, I would have walked out immediately. When I asked her colleague for her name the orignal staff member intervened again, shouting, 'Ask me, innit? I'm here!' in a threatening manner. When I asked her name, she said it was 'Rebecca,' but something tells me that wasn't her real name, as she was the only one without a name tag. In the whole kfc branch.

This employee's inappropriate, almost gangster-like behavior is unacceptable for someone in a customer service role. She needs to be held accountable for her actions and, frankly, should be terminated. No customer should be subjected to such treatment.",2025-07-09 17:34:33,en

Called in here for a sausage roll and a coffee before starting a busy day. Lovely aesthetics in the cafe, the staff especially the manager/supervisor were all very friendly and welcoming.

Some lovely classical type music was playing, the cafe is spacious with a mix of chair and comfy seating and table styles. All the usual pastries, cakes, bacon and sausage rolls are available as you would expect as well as the whole range of coffees and cold drinks.

Free Wi-Fi available through the cloud with a Sky Wi-Fi sign up and power points for laptops are also available with USB slots as well, on the bench seats look right underneath and you’ll see them!

There is limited outdoor seating available as well.

We were late for our reservation by around 10 minutes but there was no fuss when we walked in we were taken straight to our table. We already had a look at the menu online before so we knew what we wanted so we ordered (kitchen for brunch was closing at 2:45) and everything came out soo quick!!

Now where the service really excelled was in the staff. I didn’t get the name of the really lovely girl taking our order but if you suggested the whole ice cream, olive oil and sea salt combination (I haven’t tried it yet but I will!!) just know you really went above and beyond for us that day and we all really appreciated it. The bartender even made me a custom ice tea (which I definitely think should be a menu item because it was DELICIOUS). Another staff member called Fatima also told us that all dishes are freshly made each day like the focaccia bread we were having, and all the dishes are halal too!

The vibes were truly immaculate at this place, such cute interior design it was perfect for a hot summers day. They were also selling (quite big) ice cream cones for only £1.50 with your choice of sauce and toppings?? I mean if you haven’t been sold on the food and staff already at least come for the ice cream.

All in all, I definitely recommend this place for a brunch with anyone. But also I’m planning to go for tapas and sunday roast  too as recommended by Fatima because this place can do no wrong in my eyes, it deserves its flowers and I’m regretful to not have tried this place out sooner.

Very rude staff.
First of all, the bun that I had ordered was very dry and was lacking in the flavour department.
The chai latte was appalling, it tasted like straight up sweet milk - I would not recommend this especially if you are cultured. There was no spice whatsoever.
The mushroom pastry was decent yet very, very greasy.
And lastly, there was some form of cronut that we had ordered that was so hard and tough to get into - you’d need a chainsaw just to cut it up! Originally we thought we’d take this dessert to go, yet shortly changed our minds. A couple of minutes after, the manager decided to berate us for eating that one dessert in (bearing in mind everything else we had ordered to eat in). Never had a staff member assume the worst like that before and humiliate us for no apparent reason like that in our lives - would never go back! Even after the ordeal, she would keep giving us evils and dirty looks until we left.

In summary, this bakery/café is all show and not all that good in reality. Very much an Instagram vs reality moment - I would only recommend if you’re into being scolded/humiliated and dry pastries!",2024-12-09 17:58:17,en

Most recently, I tried the Bubble Fizz Strawberry drink, and it was really nice—refreshing and full of flavour.

Service here is generally fast and the staff are quite helpful, even when it's busy (which it often is depending on the time and day). The main downside is the lack of seating. If you're visiting with kids or hoping to sit and relax, you might be better off getting your drinks to go, especially during peak times.

Overall, a solid spot for bubble tea lovers!",2025-05-13 02:40:33,en

I visited the Bullring Bubbleology branch on 28th June and was quite disappointed with the experience. Upon arrival, I was greeted by an older gentleman standing at the counter with the menu turned off. He informed me, rather abruptly, that “we only have fruit teas.” I accepted that and proceeded to place my order. However, the drink I received was room temperature and tasted like tap water with some popping boba – not what I expect from a £5 bubble tea. It was so underwhelming that I ended up throwing it away.

Hoping this was just an off day, I returned during the following week and had a much better experience. I was greeted politely by a young lady with glasses and a long name, who was professional and courteous. This time, I ordered a mango milk tea and it was cold, flavourful, and actually worth the money.

I understand if a store is running low on ice or ingredients – these things happen. But being served a warm fruit tea at 4pm, when the store closes at 8pm, just comes across as careless and lazy. I hope management ensures a more consistent level of quality and service across all shifts.",2025-07-13 00:35:06,en

The decoration of the cafe is cute. The tables were clean and well maintained.

What let it down was the food. Very basic and very little of the menu is actually Disney themed. The Caesar salad was not great - you had to pay extra if you wanted chicken in it. I didn’t want the chicken but my mum did - and it was basically 2 chicken nuggets? Instead of diced chicken (without breadcrumbs), as you would normally get in a Caesar salad. Very strange. The salad had far too much vinaigrette dressing so tasted sour. The Mickey waffle was okay; Disney themed at least.

As 2 adults we were disappointed, so I can’t even imagine how disappointing it would be for children who are excited to go somewhere Disney themed and are met with this. Again, our server was lovely but the rest was disappointing and I probably wouldn’t return.",2025-08-04 12:39:38,en

Food. Cafe food with mickey shaped items. Ordered 2 mickey waffles and was told the machine was broken and we have to have round ones. We continued to order and was still waiting after 30 mins.
Service. Not great. 1 bloke trying to do everything but not managing to achieve anything. He got distracted from every job. 3 women who had 1 task and didn't do any of it well or efficiently. Not even attempting basic customer service

The server was very nice but there was only one person taking orders and making the drinks which made it slow, especially since it’s a busy area. This would have been fine if the drinks were nice but they were not.

I love bubble tea and seeing as it was my first time trying this place I went for the usually safe order of a brown sugar milk tea. However it was so watered down. I’ve had bubble teas before that just tasted like milk but this wasn’t even milk, it was watery milk.

And the whole point of a brown sugar is the syrup, which I chose after looking at the poster picture displaying the drink with  having lots of syrup all along the inside of the cup. In reality I couldn’t even see any syrup. I know pictures can exaggerate a bit but this was just false advertising. It was just brown watery milk with no syrup and the tapiocas were sticking together as well.

Also two of the drinks I asked for warm, as the sign specifically showed they offer both hot and cold, but what I received was just room temperature. I was disappointed.

Maybe their other products are fine but I would not recommend getting a milk tea from there, and if you do go expect there might be a wait.",2024-06-19 12:34:53,en

The dishes are explained well as the names of the dishes are a just little difficult to pronounce. They have dish number too so solved the problem for me!

My first venture into Elio Cafe, nestled in the heart of the Mailbox, proved to be a truly delightful experience. Stepping inside, I was immediately struck by the sophisticated atmosphere. The interior design is undeniably beautiful, with a clear emphasis on creating a refined space. The high ceilings are a masterstroke, instantly lending an air of grandeur and elegance that elevates the cafe beyond your typical coffee stop.
While the artwork adorning the walls and ceilings might be described as simple, its execution and placement are anything but. It's clear a thoughtful hand has curated the decor, achieving a sense of visual harmony that is both calming and aesthetically pleasing. The lighting further enhances this carefully crafted ambiance, creating a warm and inviting glow throughout the cafe.
The attention to detail extends to the furniture. The variety of seating options is a testament to the owner's understanding of different customer needs and preferences. Crucially, all the furniture I observed appeared to be of high quality, adding to the overall impression of a well-considered and upscale establishment. It's evident that the owner has invested significant effort in creating a unique and appealing environment, setting Elio Cafe apart from the competition.
Although I didn't sample the array of snacks and desserts on offer during this visit, a quick glance at the neighbouring tables was enough to impress. The cakes and pastries looked tempting and clearly well-received, suggesting a high standard of quality in their culinary offerings.
My focus on this occasion was the coffee, and I opted for an Americano with milk. I was not disappointed. The coffee was genuinely excellent, possessing a distinct and memorable flavour profile. It had a unique character that hinted at a blend  I hadn't encountered before, leaving a lasting positive impression.
Beyond the impressive aesthetics and quality coffee, the staff at Elio Cafe truly contribute to the positive experience. Their friendly and courteous demeanour made my visit even more enjoyable. Their attentiveness and welcoming attitude added a layer of warmth to the already pleasant atmosphere.
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Elio Cafe to anyone venturing into the Mailbox or even the wider Birmingham City Centre area. It's more than just a place to grab a coffee; it's an experience. The combination of elegant design, a thoughtfully curated ambiance, excellent coffee, and friendly service makes it well worth a visit. Elio Cafe has certainly earned a spot on my list of go-to cafes in Birmingham.",2025-01-02 19:27:13,en

We tried to book a table but the email received to our request was non- committal to this and when I arrived, the server knew nothing of our booking. There was a table however and liked the vibe and look of the place. First the food, between the three of us we went for a desi breakfast, Shakshuka, halloumi hash and shared a loaded cheese fries (originally went for the loaded nachos but out of stock) All the food absolutely delicious and would return to try more dishes as really good selection of veggie food. However the disappointment was the chai! After discussion with the server of options, I ordered what I thought was going to be a pumpkin spice chai latte. Unfortunately when it arrived, it contained coffee which I absolutely can't stand or stomach!! I returned it and the server apologised and I was given a second drink. Despite my adding several sugars, this was completely undrinkable as very powdery and bitter. My third attempt at a drink was a standard masala chai, which I took away with me but to be honest, it was on par with the masala chai teabags I use at home. Food great and if you are not a coffee phobic like me, you will probably like the drinks but unfortunately I was disappointed with the chai drinks, which I had been looking forward to trying.",2024-10-25 08:34:03,en

Nice options for coffee. Sitting available both inside and outside, with tables for 2 or more. There is a weird plantation inside, acting as a divider between the continuous sofa type sitting, but is a huge waste of space. Interior designing mistake?
The popular item here is ""White chocolate matcha"", you can get it in hot and cold (iced) versions. A kind of attraction of this place, as everyone can be seen a cup with green liquid. Worth it! Most of the drinks are available in small and large cup options.
It says skip the queue, order using App, we tried but the app wasn't working to take orders. Though you can scroll the menu in the app while in the queue, so installing it was not a total waste.
The staff is good and helpful. The guy (from India, sorry didn't catch your name) was very nice. He recommended us items for the next time. Looking forward to visiting more.

We arrived around noon, yet several dishes on the menu were already unavailable — something you wouldn’t expect so early in the day.

The service also left a lot to be desired. The staff didn’t seem particularly engaged, and there was no manager around to speak to. My friend had to request a refund because the hummus and bread were stale and dry, and even asking for olive oil felt like an effort. Thankfully, the lady who processed the refund was polite and helpful.

As for my own meal, I ordered the Turkish eggs, but they were overcooked, dry, and a very small portion for the price. The chips were also overcooked. Overall, the food quality didn’t match the high prices — I spent £24 plus service charge, yet I don’t feel we received much service at all. On top of that, they had run out of oat milk but still charged for it.
The shakshuka has whole tinned tomatoes in it which is unusual just felt like it was just thrown in there. The chefs need to take pride in what they make on this occasion I don’t think they cared to be honest.

The only positives I can mention are that the café is spacious and the drinks were nice — I enjoyed my matcha and spending time with my friends. It’s a shame, because this place has potential, but right now it’s overpriced, underwhelming, and in defo need of improvement.

Long wait times (45+ mins) + no cooling system = not a great place to dine in.

Came here twice and had very different experiences.

When a friend and I grabbed a pastry from the front, we were served and seated right away, even moving to a booth when requested. The atmosphere was great and the interior is very aesthetic and appealing for social media. No complaints here.

When I came alone a few months later to order brunch, I had a 2/5 experience. First, it took around 5-10 minutes to be seated with no acknowledgment of the long wait time, even with several moments of eye contact with staff who didn’t seem very rushed, though this can be overlooked. Second, I waited over 45 minutes for my food (not a guess or overestimate) without acknowledgment of any sort. There was a period of around 15 minutes where nothing came out of the kitchen (I had a direct view of where the food exited).

During this wait time, it was increasingly apparent how uncomfortable the space was. There was no AC and the building has no windows to open. The only cooling system was a single fan, and with the many skylights, the restaurant felt like a greenhouse. Literally outside the restaurant was cooler than inside and that’s not an exaggeration.

The food itself was alright. I ordered the harissa benedict and the only qualm I have with it was that the eggs were almost hard boiled and not runny at all. There was a lot of chorizo on it and the mushrooms were great, however I don’t think I’d pay £14 for it again.",2025-07-27 15:35:46,en

The food is excellent. Well priced. Generous portions and overall delicious.

From street level up the stairs you are greeted with a take away counter for loads of baked treat and bread which look and smell amazing.

You then have a small hallway with bench seating where the coffee are made which did get a little congested as it’s so popular. We did book which I thoroughly recommend to not have to wait for a table.

The dining room is large. Bright and airy with high ceilings, loads of green succulents and gallery walls.  Current exhibition is a photography collection of black culture in the UK. Lots of bench style seating down the middle which means you may share the bench with others (something which never bothers me)

The service speed is what lets the venue down. The coffee is excellent but always takes a long time to come. This has been a consistent issue with all my visits. The food is delicious. Beautifully cooked and seasoned. Though offering black pepper from a mill and not powered would be expected in a place like this.

Overall it’s great with slightly nonchalant service. Book ahead and make sure you have a hearty appetite.",2025-03-16 16:12:48,en

Only one security guy ruined the end of the night for us for shouting  at my boyfriends face “ because he is too tired” and he got a reaction.

Shouldn’t be shouting at clients that were enjoying the whole night without causing trouble , just because you had a long day at work.

I work as a bartender in a very busy nightclub and I have never shouted at one last costumer  ( especially knowing they been having  drinks) for wanting more drinks even when we’re closing down , I stay calm and still politely tell them it’s closed , I don’t start shouting “GO HOME” at them because I had a long shift.

Hopefully he works on that so clients don’t react that way anymore. Rest of the security were helpful and respectful to my boyfriend.

Adam’s energy, professionalism, and attention to detail truly elevated the evening. You can tell he genuinely cares about his guests having a great time. Friendly, efficient, and charismatic — he’s the kind of person who turns a good night into a memorable one.

During my last visit, a barmaid was particularly unpleasant: she spoke in a curt and impolite manner, without taking the time to listen to customers or respond properly to their requests.

As for snacks - it's not exactly snacks galore but there are those amazing uglies chocs, biscuits in a packet, soft drinks (pepsi, lemonade, tomato juice and water) and a coffee machine. There's also a selection teas (mint/green/earl grey/eng breakfast/etc.).

I mean it could be slightly better if I am honest but if you have the right ticket you can avoid the temptations of spending more money in the station or getting on with work.

Location is a bit of a pain if you are due to travel from platforms 6 upward as you have to go out of the ticket barrier and in through another one.

My night at this so-called ""nightclub"" was nothing short of appalling. From the moment we arrived, we were met with the most unprofessional, arrogant, and downright hostile staff I’ve ever encountered.
The doormen behaved like power-tripping security guards at a prison gate—condescending, cold, and completely full of themselves. They acted as if letting people in was some kind of exclusive privilege they were bestowing upon the unworthy masses. When we approached, they barely looked at us, muttering snide comments under their breath, laughing amongst themselves like a bunch of high school bullies on a power trip.

We came dressed properly, excited for a night out, and had already paid £30 each for entry. But the staff made it clear we weren’t welcome. No explanation. No reasoning. Just the most dismissive and infuriating response: “It’s just how it is tonight.”
That’s not a policy—that’s an insult.

When we tried to get clarification, we were talked over, mocked, and ignored. One staff member even rolled his eyes and walked away mid-conversation like we were beneath him. The attitude was so disgusting, I honestly can’t remember the last time I felt so deliberately disrespected in a place that calls itself a business.

This wasn't just bad service—it was blatant arrogance, unprofessionalism, and a complete lack of human decency. It was like they took pride in ruining people’s nights.

Avoid this place at all costs. There are hundreds of better venues where you're actually treated like a paying customer instead of a nuisance. I will never set foot near this joke of a nightclub again, and I strongly advise anyone with self-respect to do the same",2025-08-10 08:09:09,en

I must make a special mention for the security staff. One doorman in particular, was a real credit to your establishment. I am on crutches at the moment, and he could not have been more helpful. He carried one of my crutches and let me use him as a support when getting up the stairs and made sure I found the rest of my party who were already in the venue. At the end of the show, he came straight over to me and escorted me out through a side door, so I didn't have to battle through the crowds. Again, he supported me down the stairs and ensured I didn't fall.

As I feel it ruins the experience as the music there is often a vibe for the younger ear, so it's not a bad place just needs a few improvements.

Oh, the roof keepings leaking as well and some of the sticks are missing the pads from the top or there weighs but other than that, it's okay could be much better,  would I recommend No- will I still frequent possibly. So refub needed I feel, as the seating and painting on the walls were nice additions but the roof, tables and sticks there need to be upgraded with brand new ones asap. The staff are all pleasant and well mannered, so it's only being let down by the quality of the items there.

Lastly, the placement of the tables are  too close together so there are times where I've been bumped into mid aim of my turn which has resulted in me missing my shot or giving 2 goes away, cause the neighbouring table are way less than a pool stick away,  so maybe remove the top 2 tables and organise the space better.",2025-06-27 20:01:24,en

The building itself was a bank, so the inside was beautiful, as you would expect from an old building.

The staff at 200 Degrees Coffee were friendly and helpful. As well as the service was good.

Other important notes, this place does not accept cash/coin payments, only via card. So if you’re a O.G who would like to pay by cash/coins, I would not recommend this cafe to you. Also to note this place is not a dog free place (unfortunately). So if you were to value hygiene above all else this place is not for you.

So as a person who is a sceptic of dog culture in general I would not see myself coming back to this coffee shop.

To the dog nutters who maybe reading this review, if you like potential dog faeces/dog urine across the floor of this cafe, bumping into dogs or getting too close to dogs (near to immoral purposes?) this place is for you!",2025-05-07 20:59:51,en

Unfortunately, the staff didn’t allow us to stay because of my little brother’s food. They were not helpful at all and didn’t even try to understand the situation.

I was with my partner and saw the A board which promoted the £3.50 meal deal. The time was about 13.00pm.
We just about found the place on Cannon Street. It looked derelict from the outside.
We managed to go upstairs. 0 marks for accessibility. Anyone with mobility issues, in a wheelchair or with pushchairs won't be able to access the space, which is up narrow stairs into a large seated area.
The decor might try to give off New York style loft vibes. But it looked dated and dimly lit, cold and dirty like a run down warehouse.
The venue was empty. One person was behind the counter.
I enquired about the meal deal, to be told they were ""sold out"". I thought it's lunchtime, we're diabetic and we needed a quick bite. But if this is sold out, for a practically new eaterie, they need to do better. It's not like the venue was busy or full. There was no-one there and the offer of a meal deal ""sold out"" speaks volumes.

Massive shout-out to Bhush. Fantastic service, great banter and a sense of humour too. He made the experience better on all levels.

Yet another venue where they ask for a service charge (tip) before food arrives. What if it's terrible? I just don't like this concept. I paid it in advance, on the back of Bhush being great. Luckily the doors was also good, but I just don't like the concept.",2025-05-31 23:34:19,en

I opted for the Double Hazy IPA at first, and a Raspberry Lemonade for my wife. Then went back up for a Pinball DIPA but sadly they ran out mid-pour and I settled for an Elvis Juice Grapefruit IPA instead.

Definitely worth a visit, decent food, decent beer and friendly staff.

I challenge you to find a pint of beer of this quality at this price anywhere else in the city all day Monday to Friday

Update: I have revisited after a couple of months (which included wallet busting increases for hospitality employers such as minimum wage increasing and increases on NI plus costs of products reaching all time price highs) and what do I find when i arrive here? The price of a pint has come down by 35p on my aforementioned review.

Still giving the same amazing friendly service and now at £3.40 for a pint in the city centre while all others are starting to increase prices, makes this place a must visit.

We were halfway through our meal and still had no drinks,  we were told there was 25 minute wait but we had already been waiting half hour.  It was a really hot evening and we were parched so I asked a passing lad who worked there about them,  he went and got them for us.  Shortly after necking our sodas, we needed another but the bar was 3 layers thick with people waiting.  It took us another 25 minutes to finally get served,  there was no order to the serving and we were walked by several times,  and other people who hadn't waited as long as us got served.
Then suddenly,  a bar fairy full of smiles,  bounding energy and gorgeous floaty sleeves fluttered into the bar,  zooming around making polite happy comments to customers and cleared up the back log in a mere 10 minutes.

Visited Lane 7 Birmingham on a Saturday and, while the place is fun and staff are great, the queue to register for each game was frustrating and time-consuming — especially for those with bookings.

Also worth noting: under-18s aren’t allowed after 7pm, which feels a bit early for a weekend during school holidays. That said, customer service was excellent — staff listened to our concerns and kindly let us stay until 9pm, which we really appreciated.

I had breakfast on 1st morning and the lady couldn't have been more helpful.  But, the quality of the cooked food left much to be desired.  Barely Luke warm. Bacon like cardboard. I'm guessing the chef cooked everything off at 6am and went back to bed leaving all to congealed and solidify for the next 4 hours.  Not 3* standard by any means. Evening food bland.

Our room was worn out, poorly decorated and seemed almost neglected. seems like some redecorating needs to take place. i have attached photographs of the state of the room. Bedding wasn’t clean, many hairs found and mattress was uncomfortable. Didn’t have a pleasant nights sleep, although there was a fan in the room which made the heat bearable.

During breakfast, we were warmly greeted by staff. Food was fine with good options.

There's a bar inside the hotel but there's also Bacchus Bar downstairs - not part of the hotel but just in the floor below. Really interesting, different bar.

Breakfast was included, if you had a full English but some of the others items had a supplement (see photo)  which I thought was strange as products no more expensive. Maybe, they charged this so kitchen could concentrate on just a couple of items on the menu.

One member of our group is a wheelchair user, and after reading the helpful guidance on the theatre’s website, I booked aisle seats as advised. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel incredibly welcome. At the main entrance, we were greeted by Pete—proudly nicknamed “Batman” on his badge—which instantly brought a smile to our faces. Pete went out of his way to assist us, even radioing ahead for support. When staff were momentarily tied up, he personally escorted us to the accessible entrance around the corner.

There, we were met by Ollie, who couldn't have been more helpful. He guided us to our seats and ensured the wheelchair was parked in a safe and convenient location, tucked out of the way but easily reachable.

After the show, Ollie discreetly kept an eye on us and returned the wheelchair when we were ready to leave, making our exit smooth and stress-free.

The service we received was genuinely above and beyond. Both Pete and Ollie were kind, proactive, and a credit to the theatre. We’ll absolutely be returning—and crossing our fingers that they're working that day!",2025-07-14 20:46:58,en

B&B HOTEL Birmingham Centre,4.1,1711,"Holloway Head, Birmingham B1 1NS, UK",52.4738349,-1.902504,ChIJV-BmKWC8cEgRY8s9bXAOtB4,N/A,Rosie,1,"This happened last Saturday.

I ordered a breakfast bag from this hotel through the Too Good To Go app. The collection time was clearly stated as 10:00–10:30 AM. I arrived at the hotel around 10:10, only to be informed by a woman with glasses that the pickup time had been changed to 10:30. She simply told me, “You can either wait or leave.”

I explained that I had something  to do at 10:30 and couldn’t wait. When I asked why I wasn’t informed earlier, she said it was a third-party app and had nothing to do with them. To me, this clearly sounded like an attempt to avoid responsibility.

I find it hard to believe that Too Good To Go wouldn’t have informed me immediately if they had been notified in time. In fact, the app only sent the time change notification at 10:18 AM—by which point I had already left the hotel. This suggests either the hotel informed the platform too late, or didn’t inform them at all.

What was even more frustrating was the lack of effort from the hotel staff to resolve the issue on the spot. No apology, no solution—just “you can wait or leave.”

Although the amount of money involved was small, the hotel’s dismissive attitude was extremely disappointing. It shows poor staff training and a lack of concern for customer experience. The staff member I dealt with was unprofessional and unhelpful.

If the hotel caused the delay, they should have taken responsibility and tried to help—not just shifted the blame and left the customer with no option.

I wasn’t planning to leave a negative review, but the way this was handled left me no choice. I hope this helps others understand what to expect, and I sincerely hope the hotel takes steps to improve their service.

I also sent a formal complaint email to the hotel management shortly after the incident. It has now been four days, and I’ve received no response at all—not even an acknowledgment.

I didn’t expect much in terms of compensation, but I did expect at least a reply or some sign that the issue was being taken seriously. Sadly, this lack of response only confirms my impression: the hotel does not care about customer feedback, nor does it take responsibility for its service failures.",2025-08-07 08:37:48,en

Unfortunately, we only found out after booking that the car park was closed due to refurbishment. If we’d known that beforehand, we probably would’ve gone with a different hotel.

Check-in was great—really quick and easy, and the staff were friendly. But when we got to the room, there was a note (attached) apologising for the noise from the refurb works. We could hear really loud and ongoing building noise, which made it hard to relax.

We completely understand that renovations need to happen, but for the price we paid, it was quite disappointing—especially when we weren’t told about the disruption in advance.

As others had noted, the room was quite warm without air con but fortunately it was manageable.

Breakfast however was great value for money. There was plenty to choose from and good quality products. The staff member in the breakfast room was very friendly and efficient at clearing up empty plates/bowls.",2025-07-22 20:28:50,en

Tried them on in the main store instead of in selfridges as I first went round all the shops in Bullrjng to see which options on dresses I had before trying any on.
Sadly the one dress I thought would be the best colour for me (which it was) they didn't have my size available in the store for me to try on. They did get me the same style of dress in the right size but in a different colour to try on and if it was right they offered to offer it for me in the store that day. Sadly I did need the dress in the right colour to try on as the other colour I tried just didn't look right so I couldn't get the best option from trying that on.
Will try to come back when I'm working in town next week to order the dress, both the team members that helped me on the concession and in the store where amazing and very helpful when I was looking around.

It’s worth noting that it’s free at the point of entry which for many families I’m sure is a huge bonus when entertaining children. And there is so much within this museum to entertain young and old with a new exhibits on the top floor focused on Birmingham and it’s history.The Ozzy Osbourne display will attract many people I’m sure. It wasn’t for me but it didn’t distract in anyway the enjoyment of the museum well done to all.  It’s located in the heart of the town hall square with good access to all the shopping areas. Great to call in on a rainy day or a hot baking day. A very good shop which is not something I would ever say but it’s worth visiting and so is the cafe set in the great hall.

There are some excellent works of art,  along with exhibits showcasing Birmingham's industrial past.
The building itself is well worth close examination.
There is a shop here,  and also the Edwardian Tea Rooms.
The coffee was mediocre,  while the muffin I bought had all the characteristics of having been made at the same time as the tea rooms.
Prices are high in the tea rooms (£7.35 for substandard coffee and cake), while items for sale in the museum shop are also priced to appeal to those with higher levels of disposable income. (It's not a given that everyone who enjoys art and history also enjoys over-paying for everything...)
Aiming high with prices is fine if quality and value match the price point. I don't think it does here - call me picky, but discerning also fits...
The museum and gallery are 5-star, and entry is free,  but whoever sets the prices for what's sold here needs to better understand the concept of value to the customer. Get that right, and the required profits will naturally follow...",2025-06-06 07:23:58,en

The building itself is beautiful and full of character, with impressive architecture that makes you feel like you’ve stepped into another time.

The Pre-Raphaelite collection was definitely the highlight for me. The artwork is stunning and well presented, with just enough info to give you context without being overwhelming. There’s also a great variety of pieces throughout the museum, from historic artifacts to more modern and local art. It’s a nice mix that keeps things interesting.

All the main areas were open during my visit, which was a nice surprise since I’d heard some parts had been closed previously. Everything was well laid out and easy to navigate.

The restaurant on site was a big plus. I stopped in for lunch and was really impressed with tasty food, decent prices, and a relaxed atmosphere. It’s a good spot to take a break and recharge.

Staff were friendly and helpful, and the museum is free to enter, which is incredible for the quality of the experience. Whether you're into art, history, or just exploring interesting places, this is well worth a visit. I’ll definitely be back again.

Convenient parking location. Short walk to Chinatown, train station or the bullring. Car park is located above the indoor meat and fish market. So brace yourself once you get in/ out the lift.

The doors are not pram or disabled friendly. Manual double doors. You'll have to go through a different exit or if you are lucky someone is kind enough to open/hold the doors for you.

I recently visited Merlin's Cafe Bar and, unfortunately, it was a bit of a mixed experience. Despite the place being nearly empty, the food took a surprisingly long time to arrive, which was disappointing. When it finally did, it was no better than average—nothing particularly memorable.

On a more positive note, the service was friendly and attentive, which was a real saving grace. The staff do their best, but it’s a shame they aren’t backed up by the quality or efficiency of the food.

The decor is definitely a highlight. It’s well done and provides plenty to look at while you wait—something that came in handy given the delays.

Overall, Merlin’s has some potential, but the food needs to step up to match the good service and appealing atmosphere.",2024-12-15 17:28:38,en

Once ordered, the food arrived quickly and all was good with that. As we finished off drinks and the table was being cleared, the manager asked us to leave because there were people waiting.

Let’s start with the host. A very tall Black gentleman (only mentioning for identification, as he wore no name tag) was at the entrance. He walked right up to us, saw us waiting, and didn’t even bother to say hello. It wasn’t until I stared directly at him for a while that he finally mumbled a “hello,” as if I had to beg just to be acknowledged. Basic hospitality? Nonexistent.

We were then refused seating in a clearly open section of the restaurant — lights on, people dining, and absolutely no “reserved” signage. When asked why we couldn’t sit there, the answer was vague and dismissive. Instead, we were led to a cramped, uncomfortable spot. The entire interaction felt cold and unwelcoming.

As for the food? Laughably small portions — honestly, I wouldn’t serve this to a dog. At this price point, I expected at least something decent, but the flavors were average at best. You’re paying premium rates for barely edible, forgettable dishes.

Cold service, inflated prices, microscopic portions, and a general attitude that makes you feel like you’re the inconvenience — Fumo is a hard pass. Never returning, and I’d strongly advise others to steer clear",2025-04-09 19:10:15,en

The place is located few minutes from central station but yet slightly hidden so it’s not too busy or loud. The food was good. We took 2 slices and it was too much. They are really rich and filling! If anything, I would rather recommend getting the garlic bread.
The drink menu is full! I loved that the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I was able to taste a bit of the tap drink I was going for to ensure that I would like it. If you tell them what you like, they can recommend you suggestions and I loved that.

As we were attending a concert that evening we arrived to check in at 11:30pm, only to be told that our room was no longer available, allegedly due to a flood.. Whilst this excuse was questionable, we were offered an alternate Travelodge 30 minutes away. We agreed to stay there, as we had no other choice, and the man on the desk said he would call a taxi to take us there. 40 minutes later, there was no sign of a taxi and when asking where the taxi is, the man on the desk said he hadn't ordered it. There were also two security men in reception that evening who were incredibly rude when asking if we could use a bathroom whilst waiting.

We decided to make our own way home as nothing was being done to arrange an alternative room.

When dealing with customer services, we were given a refund on the room, but nothing else in terms of compensation. This is incredibly disappointing as we had to pay to get home. (We had no confidence there would even be another room at the other Travelodge).

We were not told prior that our room was no longer available. My suspicion would be they gave our room to someone else for a hire rate as we'd not checked in earlier. If there was a flood, surely we would have been contacted..

I would avoid this Travelodge, but also the wider group as the customer service has been terrible.",2025-07-16 09:46:21,en

After purchasing a top and a bag at the self-checkout, I noticed a label on the bag that said something like “secure tagged.” I approached a staff member near the self-checkout area and politely asked if the item still had a tag, as I didn’t want the alarm to go off when leaving the store.

Rather than checking or offering assistance, she responded in a rude manner, telling me to get in the queue. The queue was very long, with only one staff member serving many customers, most of whom were making returns, so it took a long time for me to be seen.

Eventually, when I reached the till, I was asked to step aside while a male colleague was radioed. He brought me back to the self-checkout, scanned the item, and confirmed there was no tag on it. He apologized for the experience, but by that point, I had only a few minutes left to get to work.

I had made my purchase with plenty of time to spare, but the lack of assistance and the dismissive attitude of the initial staff member caused a significant and unnecessary delay. I found her unwillingness to help extremely frustrating and unprofessional.

I am very disappointed by the service I received and hope this feedback will be used to improve the customer experience at this store.",2025-05-07 11:38:19,en

After three months, I would be eligible for a phone plan. However, when I returned after three months, they told me that my credit history was not sufficient for a phone plan. This felt misleading; it is unfair to tell customers they can receive a phone plan when there is still a credit history check involved.

I had already mentioned that I am new to the country and have no direct debits in my name. Despite this, they insisted that I take the SIM plan, which is quite expensive compared to other companies. For instance, I bought a plan for my wife from EE for just £13 per month, while I am paying £22 per month and still do not have a phone plan.

The staff member there told me to try again after another three months, which further reinforces how misleading the initial information was. I was excited about getting a phone plan after three months, and my wife and I even chose the phone’s storage and color. In the end, however, my credit history was declined, leaving me without a phone plan.

I need this issue to be addressed as soon as possible. I was hopeful about obtaining the phone plan, and now I feel frustrated. If this situation cannot be resolved, I would like to port my plan to EE.",2025-07-07 09:31:11,en

I ask the person who took the shoe off me in the first place and he was like ""oh let me check"".

I tried it on and it was slightly too large so I asked for the next size down instead. This time ANOTHER staff member when to get them and were gone a long time.

We was welcomed and seated by the manager Kai, who I must say is one of the friendliest people I’ve ever met. He gave us great suggestions for both drinks and gluten free food. As the menu only offers 1 milkshake without biscuit I kindly asked if Kai would make an alternative milkshake which he was delighted to do at the end of the night after which I’m sure he had a long shift as a manager. He absolutely smashed it and it was one of the nicest milkshakes I’ve ever had! He went absolutely above and beyond I’ve had exceptional service, and I couldn’t of asked for anything more. He really turned mine and my girlfriends date night around after having a really bad start. Thank you so much for everything Kai! Definitely coming back.",2025-08-12 21:46:20,en

We started with grilled tiger prawns and salt & pepper squid both were fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The highlight of the starters, though, was the scallops, probably the best I’ve had in Birmingham served with a rich, creamy sauce that complemented them beautifully.

For mains, my wife chose the 3-cheese pizza, which was indulgent and packed with flavor, while I went for the rotisserie chicken in a spicy honey sauce. The chicken was juicy, tender, and had just the right balance of sweetness and heat.

On top of the fantastic food, the service was great, attentive, friendly, and efficient. We had a wonderful time and can’t wait to come back!

I appreciated being given the option to choose my steak’s temperature, a detail that speaks well of the restaurant’s commitment to quality. I went for medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection. Although a fillet can sometimes be a bit tough, this one was mostly tender and exceptionally juicy. The dish came with a side of skinny fries that were perfectly crispy on the outside and delightfully fluffy on the inside. Complementing the sandwich was a beef dripping sauce—essentially a rich jus—that was simply amazing. Overall, a very good experience.

Food is always fresh and hot, the quality is quite good considering the value. Portions are quite generous.

The wings are crispy and strip's too.

The burgers are great and fresh, full of flavour. Meat is crisp but tender.

Fries are crispy usually unsalted and not greasy.

Order notes are always followed and always plenty of sauces provided.

For quality locally available fried chicken I would definitely recommend Dixy Chicken in this location. Thanks",2022-03-01 12:22:49,en

We were looking for somewhere to break our fast (iftar) and we decided to go here
We were 20 mins late to our booking due to the traffic in the city centre so I called and the person that answered just put the phone down, if it wasn’t Iftar time we would’ve gone elsewhere but due to how busy it would be everywhere else we decided to still go there
I called back and said we were 7 mins away and the time to break fast was 2 mins ago can I place my order via the phone so we can have it as soon as we get there but the person that took my call said no and put the phone down.. rude

We got there ordered our food and waited around half an hour.. do not get the mixed platter for 2 it’s a scam and so over priced for what you get.. but this is what the waiter pushed us to get
You’re better off getting two individual meals and the portions are a lot better and better value for money, the saffron rice was disappointing and was the only reason I wanted to go back.. was really bland
We noticed we were treated a lot different to the other customers as we were the only brown/muslim couple there and other tables were offered complimentary olives and sides etc.. where was ours? We got given little chunks of dried cookies to break our fast

It is unusual for me to forget a place, and that I couldn't see my review.
I guess it is my age.
Anyway it was some rather nice adverts on FB that made me want to visit last Saturday night. However I did notice that it had received mixed reviews but these never put me off a place. Most reviews don't tell you a fat lot anyway.
Parking isn't great in Harborne but we struck lucky with a space on a nearby side street. It's situated on the first floor, up a long flight and I didn't notice any provision for those with mobility issues.
Once inside it has a very nice feel, although the trip to the loo let's the side down. The wife wasn't a big fan of the unisex cubicles.
It's licenced and the bar is well stocked however you can take your own alcohol but they will add a corkage fee which I think is a £1 per person.
It was quite busy and the atmosphere was very pleasant, relaxed and somewhat respectful which makes a change. The service was pleasant, quite a few staff but some were more engaging than others.
The food was excellent, and I couldn't find fault. I noticed some reviews mentioned bland but our starter and both mains were just the opposite.
The shared sheekh kebab was very nice, it could have done with a few more seconds in the microwave but it was very tasty and quite large.
The chicken Chetinad and a chicken curry were hard to tell apart until you tasted them. The Chetinad although a 'thinner' curry than I would prefer had layered spicing more typical of Indian style cooking than Bangladeshi.
The sides were excellent, especially the naan. None of that tricolour pilau rice either. The chips were good, could be better but I would say that for all but one 'Indian' restaurant in the Midlands.
I thought the bill was surprisingly good taking everything into consideration and I would be more than happy to go back.",2025-05-30 21:35:21,en

The pizza arrived hot and fresh, with that signature soft, chewy crust and a generous layer of cheese. I went with the classic Pepperoni and added some extra mushrooms—flavors were solid and the toppings were nicely distributed.

The garlic dip is still one of the best parts of the meal—creamy, rich, and perfect for crust-dipping. The sides (cheesy garlic breadsticks and chicken poppers) were decent, though a little greasy.

Delivery was on time, packaging was secure, and everything was still warm when it arrived. Prices are a bit higher compared to some other chains, but the quality generally matches up.

We went there during the week so it was rather quiet, which we actually prefer. The restaurant has a nice bar in the front of the house, where you can enjoy a range of interesting and imaginative cocktails, but they serve classics too. The restaurant part is at the back and you pass an open plan kitchen with bar seats as well, where you can see all the master preparation, it's really interesting! There are normal tables as well obviously, further back.
We had a tasting menu with wine pairing. I really enjoyed the finger food that comes before the main menu, but all dishes were great. Some interesting matches, but also some surprisingly simple dishes like a pasta with butter, truffle and cheese, were absolutely delicious, and nicely paired with the wine. You can taste the quality of ingredients, and masterful preparation just completes the dish. The service is impeccable, friendly and knowledgeable. The sommelier was particularly good, clearly knowing his trade, but also very approachable and nice to talk to.
The whole menu comes to about 8 or 9 dishes, so it's a lot, and we struggled a bit to finish it all!

My partner is Gluten Free, and Harborne Kitchen went out of their way to accommodate that dietary requirement.

We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we stepped in. We were greeted by all the staff and even the chefs all said allow as we walked by the pass to our seat.

We both went for the tasting menu. And I had the wine pairing. The food was exceptional. Beautifully presented, and each plate was introduced to us by one of the chefs. There are one or two reviews on here complaining about portion size. I think the problem here is common with a taster menu. Especially the Malloreddus. That dish was so good. I wanted to get a big big bowl of it, change into my fat pants, sit on my sofa, and scoff the lot. We were both waddling out of the restaurant after, so there are no complaints from us about portion size.

My only criticism is the tomato course, which is literally a slice of tomato with a couple of onions chucked on. Served with a little bit of stock. I can't understand why it is on a taster menu at a fine dining restaurant.

The decor was nice. The atmosphere was very pleasant. Good vibes all round. And we appreciated the birthday wishes with a chocolate treat. Thank you, Harborne Kitchen. We will definitely be back soon 😋",2024-10-13 14:39:12,en

We ordered Kung pow chicken and you could really taste the vinegar. It wasn’t too overpowering though. It was a good balance of flavours. We also had the basa fish dish full of Szechwan flavours. The fish was perfectly cooked, really meaty and moist. The dish wasn’t too spicy even though there were lots of chillis in the sauce but I experienced a delightful numbing sensation on my lips which I was informed by my fellow diner was from the peppercorns. These two dishes were all we ordered between us (approx £8 each) but each came with a side of stir fried vegetables, fluffy white rice and a tomato and chicken soup. It was a feast! We were told if we ran out of these sides we could ask for more. I was tempted to, but I was too full! I really recommend this café and I will certainly like to return to try the other dishes.

The price and quality just don’t match.

We started with the seafood platter, which overall was decent. The sauces were the highlight and added a lot of flavour, but the shrimp was slightly overcooked and the scallops were a bit rubbery. Still, the sauces made up for it.

For the main, I went for the hot platter, which was quite underwhelming. There was barely any beef - mostly just a lot of vegetables. It was very spicy, which I don’t mind, but the overall flavour was just average. Honestly, your local Chinese takeaway could serve up more flavour. The rice was also just plain and nothing special.

The one thing that really stood out was the mocktail – it was excellent. Other than that, the meal didn’t leave a lasting impression, and I wouldn’t recommend it based on this experience.

For over £50 per person, you can definitely find a better place to dine. The food just didn’t taste authentic, local, or like the homemade-style Thai food you’d expect.",2025-06-24 22:02:54,en

My last visit before today I asked for the meat cut from the kebab and not to be taken from the pots where it is left to dry! and they ignored my request.

So today I specifically asked for the meat to be cut and was told I would have to wait 15 minutes.  I advised I was more than happy to wait and the place was empty so it's no real chore.

Then the man who I assume was the boss was saying he just cut it before I arrived (convenient) so eventually I relented and accepted it from the pots.  HEY PRESTO!! dry meat that has clearly been sat there for a while just because there appears to be an insistence of ignoring what the customer wants.

I've been in countles chip shops and most will take ten minutes or more to get it hot enough to cut from the skewer.

It hasn't take Island house long to end up being just as crap as Sir Harry's chippy before it.  Always cutting corners charging premium prices for basic chip shop food.

I will not be setting foot in this establishment again.  Another new broom sweeps clean all because of a man who just pretends he's done something when this is clearly not true.",2025-07-31 18:22:26,en

The wine selection is impressive, featuring a variety of options that perfectly complement the meals. Whether you’re a wine connoisseur or just enjoy a good glass with dinner, you’ll find something to love here.

The service was top-notch, with attentive and friendly staff who made us feel welcome and well-cared for throughout our meal. The atmosphere was equally excellent, with a open and vibrant ambiance that made for a great dining experience.

One of the best parts about Buonissimo is the value for money. Despite the high quality of the food and service, the prices are very reasonable, making it a great choice for both special occasions and casual dining.

Checking Google maps for restaurants nearby I came across with this Italian restaurant Buonissimo. Pretty from the pictures, attractive menu just I wasn’t sure if they do take away so I called. Pretty little voice answered, that was Irma. I explained what I want and she only had to check with chef if food collection was ok.
Chef Mark comes on the phone and he finds out that I am in hospital and family will come to collect food etc. Next thing he starts recommending what he believes it’s suitable for me, about the food texture and storage everything that I needed but I didn’t know nothing about it.
Cut the story short, my family picked up the food and delivered to me with a lovely note from Irma and chef Mark, a wonderful bunch of flowers and of course a delightful Tiramisu from them ❤️.
I have no words to describe the feelings and the emotions I felt. The food I had was Pate D’anatra as starters and Rigatoni alla Buonissimo, sorry I have no pictures of the food but I have photos of the most touching gesture I have ever had in my life !!!
Thank you so much for the good wishes🙏🏼
Food was amazing, delightful taste, I believe the bread is baked in the house. Outstanding Customers service, very friendly team.

The chutney trays accompanying the poppadoms were the best I have had, ever.
The sheekh kebab was quite hot and flavoursome but I prefer a finer minced lamb. The salad was excellent and it came fried onions which is not always the case in Harborne.
The mains and sides were perfect for us, couldn't fault anything. None of that tri-colour food colouring in pilau rice either.

Could well be!
I absolutely love the chips here at Gabriels. Why? Well it starts with the easy parking despite being at the top of the busy Harborne High Street. With some spaces on the road and additional spaces on the car park (just remember to enter your car reg on the tablet on the counter in the shop!).
Then the actual shop is very smartly presented and clean. You can even see the food being prepared and your order being made out.
The staff are so nice and polite that you feel you stepped in your own kitchen. And they dress clean and tidy which is so important for me.
But the food is where it is actually at. The chips are without doubt the best I have ever had and I have eaten all over the world. They are the best potatoes for sure and they are cooked to perfection. Neither undercooked nor overly heated. And they are always fresh. Never reheated either.
I just couldn't resist in putting my box of chips on the ground outside the shop to capture a photo of the delicious chips today. YUMMY YUMMY, HAPPY TUMMY :)",2025-04-28 03:28:56,en

Held a corporate event here and can't fault the service provided by Liam and the team. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a function venue in the centre of Birmingham. The only warning I would put out is don't park in the multi storey campus car park which I did by mistake as there is free venue parking at weekends... Multi storey is £25 to park here on a Sunday afternoon. Thankfully Liam sorted this out for us but I was stunned at the rate being demanded.

As for the Pavilion, as a said - staff were all very helpful and friendly. The food was great for both flavour and quantity. The room arrangement worked really well - bar area with separate room to sit and eat. Toilets were also within booked area so didn't have to go out to public space and that helped make  the event feel very private.

8 would recommend and use again....",2019-04-17 23:21:05,en

The service was excellent – friendly staff and everything was brought out in good time.

I had the chicken wrap, which was packed with flavour, juicy chicken, and a nice kick of spice. The chips were crispy and well-seasoned, and the pasta was creamy and comforting – perfect as a side dish.

To note, the menu says signature chips, but it's just regular chips, albeit they weren't greasy or thin french fries.

Even ordered a doggy bag to go.

Overall, it was really solid food, generous portions, and a place I’d happily return to. Great value and quality!

The oxtail was more bone than anything, and the steam veg portion was minimal. The rice lacked flavour, as did the meat, and I was just really disappointed. Then, I decided to order a piece of jerk chicken from the drum outside. That came to the table, and it wasn't steaming like the other food. Tasted it, and it was cold. When I then told the young woman the chicken was cold, she then went on to lie to me and tell me it had just come off the drum from outside. I'm certain that did not just come off the drum from outside as  it was cold and did not taste fresh. I wouldn't eat here again as there is nothing authentic about this shop or the food, and the young woman who lied to me did kill any hopes of a better rating. There was a young black guy in there who, if I weren't for him, then I would give this place the lowest rating possible. He made the experience enjoyable for me by asking me if the food was alrite and if I needed anything else and just generally a well-spoken, attentive, polite young man. Avoid this place if you can, as you will be greatly disappointed if you taste their so-called authentic food. Also, the price paid and the food of that low quality. Not again",2025-01-05 11:49:54,en

After tried to reason with them they agreed to refund me.
I called the store again after 10mins, they decided to gaslight me again saying that I needed to cancel the order and it get refunded or pay £2 pounds extra to get the order. They also asked me to go to the shop tomorrow to see that the food was cooked, knowing that was not the problem. I see that as a safety issue.

I dropped in a bit after 9pm — the place was still busy with a steady flow of online orders. I noticed a large pot of lamb curry sitting on the counter and asked about it. A staff member said it had been freshly made about 30 minutes earlier.

I ordered it with rice — served on a single plate with a small side of salad and a bit of yoghurt sauce. No drink included. Total cost: £10.

The curry was tasty, but that’s about it. It was just lamb pieces on the bone in sauce — no vegetables, no extras. Most of the pieces were either bone or full of cartilage, with very little actual meat. For £10, especially in a student-heavy area, the portion and quality just didn’t feel worth it.

I left still hungry and ended up going to Dixie’s for a burger straight after. Disappointing overall.",2025-08-03 22:10:34,en

The café is located near the university and is popular with students. Listening to their conversations brought back fond memories of my own student days.

The lady serving is friendly and polite .
I ordered a few dishes with rice and noodles sides ,  everything was bland and the meats were overcooked  and dry .. pork ribs were coloured bright red  but the meat was tasteless and tough ,
Chicken dish was poor & flavourless
Roast duck , don't waste your money !  ours was actually burnt and cut in to cubes ?? Dry and tasteless again ..

Don't dare to try order from the till everyone looks at you but until you literally say is anyone serving or just staring. Someone then may stroll over. The staff really seem like working their was literally there last choice. Very rarely are the chicken pieces decent sizes. I tend to drive further out if I want KFC this being my local would be great if staff/management actually wanted to be there. Every few months I give it a try to see if anythings changed but nope it actually gets worse. They should just close down or hire staff that actually want to be there. They need random secret shoppers. Literally the only KFC I refuse to even try ever again. A Roscoes would be a better fit there.,2025-06-22 10:48:11,en

I ordered a vegan burger and a bacon cheese (beef) burger with Uber Eats from GBK.  When my food arrived (stone cold), neither of the burgers were labelled.  They looked identical, meaning that, without the labels, it was impossible to identify which burger was vegan and which contained meat.  Neither of the burgers contained bacon, meaning that we could not even use the bacon to identify which burger was the meat burger - and increased the possibility that our order was just wrong and that both burgers were beef burgers!

When we contacted GBK, they were really rude and offered no help whatsoever; we were not offered a replacement or a refund.  Uber Eats only gave us a 79p refund on a £22 order to cover the delivery charge rather than the mix up with the food.  This meant that we were unable to eat our meal and ended up £22 out of pocket and having to buy food from elsewhere.

Unbelievably disappointed.  If you have dietary requirements especially, I would strongly suggest not eating/ordering from here.",2022-08-09 13:22:14,en

I ordered fried piece biryani, but instead, they served a dish with a tomato-flavored gravy and cold chicken pieces. When we explained the issue to the waiter, he dismissively insisted it was fried piece biryani and told us to eat it, claiming it would taste nice. I’ve never encountered such an unprofessional response.

Additionally, the family dum biryani we ordered for our group was served cold, completely lacking in flavor and hygiene. As a Hyderabadi, I know what authentic biryani should taste like, but this was utterly disappointing. They couldn’t even manage to serve hot food, let alone focus on taste or quality.

Chicken Dum Biryani – hands down 10/10. If you like your food spicy (like I do — the spicier the better), this place hits the spot. You can actually talk to the restaurant about the spice level, which is great. The rice was super fragrant and packed with flavor. I usually only have biryani every few months, but in the last 3 weeks alone, I’ve already had it three times here. That says something!

Tried the Chicken Liver with Tandoori Naan today — wow. It was amazing and honestly made me a bit homesick. Haven’t had liver since I was back home, and this took me right back. So good.

Then we had the Masala Chai — it comes in a smaller cup than I’d usually go for, but considering the price, it makes sense. Plus, it was really good! Totally recommend it after your meal.

The vibe at the place is great, and the service has been one of the best I’ve experienced in Birmingham so far. It gets pretty busy in the evenings, but it’s super chill during the day — perfect if you’re looking to grab lunch and maybe get some work done (I usually catch up on emails there).

We came there at around 330pm. They were quite busy as we had to wait awhile for the food. We waited a bit for the starters to come but the intervals between starters and mains is ok as the wait for the mains was not that long. Food is great though and worth the wait. Staff are friendly and helpful. Decors in the restaurant we’re nice. Provided that the restaurant is busy it was still clean and tidy. It took a whole for the ice maker to generate some ice though. I guess as the weather got a bit more warmer in the afternoon everyone wanted ice. Just the soft drink felt a bit flat so this might need looking at.

We waited 35 minutes for our mains, seeing tables seated before us getting served. When our food eventually turned up, all the chicken was cold, and the sides weren't any better.
When we raised this a supervisor/manager came over and took it away to get new dishes.
Unfortunately, when the replacements turned up, the chicken was barely warm again, but by this point, having already driven half the country, we weren't up for more waiting.

Mind you it's never been good but never this bad either.

They speak little English which is fine cuz you can just point at the menu but they treat non-Chinese customers differently. No basic customer service skills, no communication. The only times I've felt welcome here was when I would come with my Hong Kong friend. The girl who took my order looked almost bothered by my presence there but smiled at Chinese customers. Rude tone too.

Ordered kung pao chicken and the A1 option. When I got home I realized she didn't give me the chicken dish but another beef one. I don't know how she misunderstood since there's no beef dish next to it on the menu. They used to put a tea egg in the rice but not anymore which is disappointing. They sometimes give free soup with your order. Except that today I had to ask for it even tho the takeaway order before mine got free soup and so did everyone at the tables inside.

The food itself is good, tho the A1 option was just decent, the ""sauce"" is just red oil that sinks to the bottom and doesn't give much flavor so I wouldn't recommend it.

Recently, they released a new filled range, hazelnut chocolate, raspberry cheesecake & pistachio. They’re good, but nothing beats the original cookies!

Chinese customer please don't go there.
had an extremely upsetting experience at this M&S Foodhall in Selly Oak.

I requested to speak with the manager, who eventually reviewed the footage and confirmed I had not been involved in any wrongdoing. Only then was I allowed to enter. After purchasing two bottles of drinks and showing the receipt, the guard finally let me go, but without any apology or accountability for the humiliation I endured.

The whole experience felt like racial profiling, and left me feeling deeply embarrassed and angry. As a paying customer and a student living in the area, I expect to be treated with basic respect and fairness, not suspicion and hostility.

M&S, please train your staff—especially security—to handle such situations more professionally, and not to assume guilt based on appearance. This was not just a mistake; it was a deeply damaging and humiliating experience.",2025-08-07 10:41:49,en

Either the spices are way too overpowering, or the flavour just isn’t there. So when my friend mentioned a new takeaway called Dr Shawarma that opened just 5 minutes from where I live, I wasn’t in a rush to try it. I thought, “Here we go again, nothing new.”

But tonight hunger hit hard, and as I was driving down Bristol Road, I spotted Dr Shawarma and thought, “You know what, let’s give it a go.” I told myself I’d get the chicken shawarma meal — and if it flopped, at least I’d still have the chips to fall back on.

There was a bit of a queue, but it moved quickly. The staff were really friendly, and I got my food quicker than expected. Now here’s the real moment… I opened the shawarma not expecting much, took a bite and OH MY — absolutely delicious. The flavour was spot on, tasted genuinely like something you’d get in the Middle East. It had that perfect balance of spices, not overpowering at all. And the chips? Fresh, crunchy, and actually worth mentioning!

You’d think expectations would be low – after all, it’s just chicken, right? But there are still plenty of ways it can go wrong.

Let’s start with the chicken: overall, it tasted great. I went for the super hot and it was a good balance of spice and flavour – definitely the highlight of the meal. However, the spicy rice was a big letdown. It wasn’t spicy at all, extremely sticky, and honestly gave off the impression it had been cooked days ago and reheated. It felt more like sushi rice than anything that should come with grilled chicken.

The best way to describe the whole experience is this: like your local takeaway trying to be Nando’s. Tables weren’t clean – the place was quiet with barely anyone around, and yet when I sat down, my arm landed on a sticky, dirty surface. Not the best first impression.

The one real positive was the service – friendly and helpful. And because the chicken wasn’t bad, it’s not a 1-star review. But overall, there’s a lot of room for improvement.",2025-06-24 22:10:00,en

I sat in the seated area and witnessed some of the best cafe customer service ever. Many people were served very quickly and without any fuss or frustration on display. Groups of paramedics, patients, hospital staff and visitors were all involved in some form of conversation during order taking and whilst making collections.  I was really surprised for some reason. It was good to see.

One member of staff went above and beyond helping me with a phone issue I had and considering the circumstances of why I am at the QE today waiting she has no idea how much I value that gesture of kindness.

I feel that the management of this cafe should recognise and reward all the team members working today as they really are doing a great job and are a credit to Costa Coffee. They did not run out of friendliness, enthusiasm and energy in all the time I was here over 2 hours during peak times on a Saturday.

The staff is dishonest and rude.

I should've read the reviews before coming but I didn't, as many others agree that the staff is rude.

I came to buy a £4 meal deal, which fits my budget as a student. The meal deal includes a sandwich, a drink, and a snack. However, the particular sandwich I picked up wasn't included in the meal deal, so I ended up paying £7.90, it's my fault really, but the staff was annoyed when I asked.

I was gonna buy a cup of tea but I've already used up my lunch budget, so I asked the staff politely if she could fill my cup with some hot water please, she told me that their hot water machine is broken too, same as the one in library lounge. Yes the one in library lounge is broken, that's why I asked if I could get some hot water from the café, after paying for a meal as a customer. But the machine in the café isn't broken. All other customers behind me all managed to get tea that's filled with hot water.

Is it that hard to be a nice, decent and considering human once for a while?

Ordered one cheese board and one Meat board for about 19-20£ each expecting that would fill us up. Previously have gone places and got a decent amount of food. when complaining about the amount of food given they told us it was all locally sourced. However, if this is true we would personally want to be educated on where it is sourced and be educated on this, as when going cheddar that was what happened. However, the cheese and meat seemed to be poor quality as seen in picture and was thinly sliced which does not seem to be high quality, seemed more like a processed meat selection. It also did not state this anywhere on menus or walls ect. When we complained they also pushed back saying they understand we are students but we looked at the menu beforehand and was looking at spending about £20 each as was my birthday meal, and that was not the point of why we were upset with our food. Left feeling very underwhelmed and disappointed. Seems a steep price for what you get as no information shared, the board didn’t seem a really quality and you got about 10 slices of meat for £20. It also stated it came with crackers but i can’t see any on this picture. service was good as told us nice wines and made recommendations however when we complained they did nothing about the situation and pushed back with reasons we were not informed on",2025-05-16 09:21:32,en

My experience was horrible I felt so out of place and actually thought I was at the wrong venue . So after waiting in a queue in a busy coffe shop for over 10 minutes I finally got to the counter where I had to announce in front of everyone waiting in the queue behind me my reason for being there . Which was not ideal and I did question if I was actually at the right place . The ladies behind the counter were lovely and friendly but as I wasn’t asking for a coffee it took her two times of me explaining before she understood why I was there . I was then taken to a corridor where there was again a lovely lady who helped me but said it’s more a drop in hub for students and to maybe try a different one . I felt so uncomfortable there as I wasn’t asking for the only person there over 30 and even if I’d wanted to purchase a coffe it was out of my price range I think the cheapest one was £5.00 so who ever said students are broke haven’t been around students these days . The whole experience was uncontrollable and not to mention parking I had to park theee streets away and walk a good 10 minutes .

We flagged someone else down who immediately just said ""well it's busy isn't it"", not busy enough to stand and gossip round the coffee machine. We mentioned our drinks were long gone at this point and we were just getting annoyed. A further 10 minutes later and our food finally arrived, (55 minutes after we ordered), the lady didn't even speak to us. No apologies, no 'do you need anything else', 'any more drinks'. Nothing. Noone checked back on us and when we left, no one would make eye contact.
The food was absolutely delightful - it's just a shame I won't be back due to inpolite and rude staff members.

We had gone elsewhere originally, but foolishly didn’t check the menu online, and it wasn’t really to our liking.

So we ended up taking a short walk here.

We haven’t been for a few months, as a guy here (possibly the manager) has been rude and snappy with us a few times. Tonight was anything but that. It was a great experience and really restored my confidence in this place.

The bad (if I have to say it)
Two staff. And one of them - Will, I think? - pulled from the bar. Absolutely wonderful lads, who managed to look after the entire main area of the restaurant, but clearly needed help. It would have been a lot more efficient with just one more person. But they did their best. They were warm and welcoming, offering wonderful advice, remembering it was my birthday, and just having fun with us. This counts for SO much, and it’s a big reminder of how awesome this place can be.

The good? Again, the two guys on waiter duty. Much respect for managing to look after the place. You were excellent.
The gent who made me a whisky sour. My favourite cocktail, and I just haven’t managed to get one in Birmingham since I came back from abroad. And he made it to perfection. Even including the egg white. What. A. Legend.
The chicken wings. I know, I know. They’re chicken wings. But that glaze…

Honestly, the food is always good here. My burger was decent, but I wish I had had my wife’s summer aubergine salad. That was absolutely amazing.

Excellent wine choices. I appreciate they are triple retail price, but they’ve clearly gone through work to source, as Highfield has never let me down with a good wine. So I’m happy to pay.
And one of the best things? We didn’t even have to pay much as they gave me £25 off with it being my birthday…

Food, ambience, cleanliness, decor - all great.

But it’s the people that will keep me coming back. And the staff on tonight… Will and the other gent. And the legendary bartender (Steve? Apologies if I have that wrong).

Just a really good birthday meal, folks. Not too pricey, and the most fun my wife and I have had out in ages.

Thank you, guys!",2025-07-31 22:12:40,en

I had the absolute pleasure of visiting The Blue Piano in Edgbaston, and what an evening it was! I made the trip especially to see the incredibly talented Dr Stephen Tromans perform, and he did not disappoint. From the moment he and the other musicians took the stage, the energy in the room was electric.

The music was nothing short of breathtaking—rich, soulful, and deeply moving. I found myself listening with my eyes closed, heart open, completely lost in the magic unfolding before me. Stephen Tromans plays with such passion and skill; his connection to the music is something truly special. I was absolutely blown away.

The atmosphere at The Blue Piano only enhanced the experience. It’s an intimate and vibrant venue, perfect for live jazz. The warmth of the crowd, the outstanding musicianship, and the sheer beauty of the music made it an evening to remember. The venue’s commitment to showcasing top-quality jazz acts really sets it apart, making it a must-visit for any jazz lover.

I travelled quite a distance just to see Stephen Tromans perform, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. His presence brought something truly special to the venue, and it was clear I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. I really hope The Blue Piano books him again soon—he and the other musicians created an unforgettable experience, and I know many would love the chance to experience it again.

If you love live jazz in a welcoming and atmospheric setting, The Blue Piano is the place to be. I can’t wait to return for another fantastic evening of music!",2025-03-23 21:11:56,en

They gave the option to swap out any of the items for something else, and we chose to swap out the egg and sausages for extra hash browns, as the hash browns from the Morrisons Cafe are unbeatable! The hash browns were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, the perfect hash browns!

The interior of the cafe was spacious and there was plenty of seating area. There were tables for two as well as tables for larger groups, which we thought was very convenient. We were sat at a table near the window, so we had a view whilst we were having brunch.

A special mention to Vinny, who was brilliant—attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making our meal even more enjoyable.

The only minor downside is that parking at the location can be a bit tricky. However, there’s plenty of parking nearby, so it’s not a major issue.

The Three Church Road restaurant is a bit hard to access - there are main doors with a sign saying the entrance is to the left, and you walk through what I think is the reception to the retirement home? It’s not very clear but we were able to find it without too much hassle.

The restaurant/bar is very beautifully designed, with lots of different rooms and areas to keep it feeling intimate and private, rather than everyone packed in one big room. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and made it a lovely occasion.

We’d come for the afternoon tea, which seems to be good value at £19.95 but was rather disappointing - largely due to the pretty boring sandwich flavours (tuna, ham & mustard, cheddar & chutney, and chicken tandoori) and the fillings were absolutely tiny - I don’t think I tasted any tuna. The staff were great in tailoring the food to dietary requirements, for vegans, gluten free, and generally fussy people who just wanted an entire plate of ham sandwiches! It was just sad they’d not opted for things such as smoked salmon and cream cheese, egg and cress, and cucumber sandwiches.

And the finger sandwiches came heaped in butter - a white margarine spreadable type thing. Sad. There were scones with individual pots of cream and jam, and a range of cakes though I found these to be quite dry.

Particularly with the sandwiches there felt like a lot of cost-cutting had been going on, and you could barely taste any of the fillings. You can pay £5 extra to enjoy Champagne with your afternoon tea, or gin & tonics.

Despite my disappointment with the food, it looked beautiful and was a lovely thing to do with friends, and we were very well looked after by the staff.",2023-04-17 21:46:07,en

We started our meal with the Joojeh Koftah Kebab, which was presented well but could have been better in terms of flavor. However, the rest of the dishes truly impressed us. The Sultani Lamb Chops were succulent and well-seasoned, and the Kabuli Pulav stood out with its rich aroma and perfectly balanced flavors. Each dish was plated beautifully, adding to the overall dining experience.

To accompany our meal, we tried two drinks—Persian Sage and Persepolis—both of which were refreshing and paired well with the food.

What made the evening even more special was the thoughtful gesture from the staff. Knowing it was our anniversary, they greeted us with a personalized card and a plate of delicious baklava. The baklava was flaky, sweet, and just the right end to our meal.

They have always been so warm and welcoming, especially with kids, and of course the pizza (gorgonzola and pear all time fave) and cocktails (chilli and yuzu margaritas please) are stunning.

The above led us to approach them to ask if they would host a small wedding reception for us and our nearest and dearest (around 30 people) which Clare and Paul accepted enthusiastically. They were so easy to work with especially in the run up to our big day, nothing was too much trouble and they absorbed much of the stress that comes with planning any event let alone your own wedding.

When it came to the day, the room was decorated beautifully (by Sophie I believe) and everything from the food to the service was flawless. The staff were so genuinely kind, relaxed and accomodating which created a lovely atmosphere for our celebration. We even arrived a little earlier than planned and this was no trouble at all. All of our guests (including vegans and other dietary requirements) were catered for perfectly and have all vowed to visit again.

Clare & Paul were also kind enough to also let us use an extra (also spacious) side room for the kids and even brought out toys etc for them to play with. This was something which meant we could really enjoy ourselves without having to occupy our very busy 2 year old!

We have never experienced such good hospitality and would highly recommend not only eating at Smoke & Ash once a week for the rest of your life, but also booking them for any similar gathering you might be planning. Thank you everyone for a perfect day.

The strawberry milkshake was delicious. A good quality milkshake.

This place appears to be a busy deli shop for the local businesses. The prices are reasonable and the service is fast. Good selection of food to choose from. You can either do takeaway or they have limited seating inside and more seating outside on a quiet street.",2025-07-26 10:34:17,en

A small operation and the service was unusual. They don’t make the sandwiches in front of you like most sandwich places i’ve visited, so you can’t tell them how much of something to add. The pricing structure is inconsistent and they charge extra for salads. The interior is very small and only seats 4 people but there is outdoor seating. But usually people opt for take away here.

Small sandwiches and barely any filling. Very disappointing. I was still hungry after eating a sandwich. Taste was okay but nothing revolutionary.

Decent for a quick bite to eat if you are unable to make your own sandwich. But overpriced for the quality you get.",2024-08-06 16:37:36,en

Parking is found on the side road or in the back but parking in the back is limited.
Food you could order through the QR code on the tables or at the counter and we did both as some of the party weren't comfortable with technology like that and they also wanted to adjust the order.
There was a little delay to my food but all due respect to our server, who came to advise that there was a small error in preparing it and it would take just a little longer. The update was really appreciated.

With about 15 acres to explore you could easily spend 3-4hrs here!

Perfect for a nice relaxed afternoon if you go during the week, I imagine it's quite a bit busier on the weekends and school holidays.

Be aware that the hot-houses are very hot and humid! Probably 30-35? so if you go in the colder months make sure you can remove some layers easily.

The grounds are broadly wheelchair accessible, with sloping ramps. Although if possible take someone who is able to open doors as one door in the cacti room to an accessible ramp does get stuck and some slopes (while gentle for those walking) could be a little steep for a manual chair.

Plenty of benches around, some in the sun and some in the shade as well as a large gazebo-like structure near the rose garden you could duck into if it rains.

Perfect for kiddos, if you park yourself in the cafe with a view to the hothouse door you can safely send them off on their own to run around for hours. There is a plat area as well if that's more their thing than running through bushes.

Love the little shop, lots of gardening bits as well as cards, pottery and artwork all priced fairly high as you would expect for any garden centre/ public attraction.

I recently spent a beautiful day exploring Birmingham Botanical Gardens, followed by a delightful brunch at Medicine Bakery—and I couldn’t recommend the combination more!

The Botanical Gardens were absolutely stunning. From the moment you step in, you're greeted by peaceful pathways, lush greenery, and glasshouses filled with exotic plants from all around the world. Each section felt like its own little ecosystem—whether it was the tropical house with giant palms and koi ponds, or the arid house showcasing cacti and succulents. It’s an ideal spot for a quiet walk, a bit of inspiration, or even just to unwind with nature.

The space is bright and modern with a creative vibe—housed in a former gallery—which adds to the atmosphere.  the pastries at medicine bakery are genuinely next-level.

I admit to not knowing my Schloer from my Bolinger. So what attracted me to Loki Wine & Deli? It was the bright lights of its humble deli counter and the promise of mince pies. At the small deli counter I could see the beautiful, yet straightforward, range of cheeses, hams and antipastos. These are more to complement the wines than a meal outright.
The wine is elegantly presented on its many wooden shelves around the perimeter of the shop. The wooden standing platform on the left hand side of the shop was well lit, displaying the more audacious drink varieties. There are a few tables to sit down and relax in the company of groups and grapes. The staff appeared helpful and I’m sure knowledgeable on the subject of wines.",2021-12-23 16:26:00,en

The room was tired and looked as if it gets zero maintenance. I asked for a double but had 2 single beds pushed together they were not secured so separated during the night causing a gap. I was concerned with the hygiene of the room as there were cobwebs above the mirror and ceiling. The light pull cord was filthy and there was no handle on the inside of the shower. Lighting in the room was awful they still use the old bulbs which emit yellow light the main ceiling lampshade had dead flies inside. I mentioned all this to reception who offered me another room I declined and requested its cleaned tomorrow. When I retuned next day after room was serviced it was exactly the same very poor housekeeping standards. Bar and restaurant is across the road in the main centre very pleasant but mega expensive i.e. bottle of pale ale £6.50. There are no bars or shops near so its a long walk or taxi every time you need to go out if you dont drive like me. The price was very good compared to city centre but by the time you add all the extras its not much of a difference, next time I will pay city centre prices and have a more comfortable stay.",2024-04-30 13:08:32,en

First impressions, the location is lovely and once you've found the secure car park it is really convenient getting to the centre.

The room was lovely and well decorated. However it was so hot the thermostat said it was 27 degrees! We couldn't get the air con to circulate cold air and didn't have a fan. We left the 3 windows open which were on the ceiling as we were on the top floor. However when we got back the room had filled with leaves from the trees above making a mess everywhere!

So we had to sleep with the windows partially open and extremely hot. Then in the morning the birds made a lot of noise which continued when we shut the windows.

The only time I saw any staff was when checking in and you now have to phone a number to talk to ""reception"" who are off site.

When my key card failed, the reception gave us the code to a keybox to obtain one of their master keys that could open any door in the hotel. It was quite unnerving knowing that any other guest could get into any room, especially as the  deadbolt on the door to my room did not work. With no staff on site, other guests were also unchallenged when arguing loudly near my room.

The fire alarm was also sounding on the second night of my stay and showing a fault code. When calling reception  they struggled to understand the issue and said they had finished for the day and wanted me to send an email so that someone else could deal with it! Someone did come, but they only silenced it rather than sorting whatever the fault was.

Whilst the rooms are still nice and the location is good, there was a skip outside the hotel and I genuinely thought it had closed down when I first arrived. There is no longer a restaurant/bar either as that is now a separate business.

With a little work this could be a great hotel again but the lack of staff and resulting safety issues would really put me off staying again.",2025-02-22 10:46:36,en

There’s a bridge to walk over with a stream/pond and very large leaves from some of the plants.

Was a nice restaurant that served nice food, has it was a nice hot day we sat on the terrace enjoying the views.  Plus I can’t believe this was 20 minutes away from where we live.

The cafe was pleasant  but he struggled with the choice of food as it was limited.A bit on the expensive side too .Sorry no pictures!

Words can't express how happy we are with the entire experience, and of course the end product. Many of our team felt uncomfortable having photos taken, but where immediately put at ease by Richard - and have all commented on how the experience was much more pleasant than they had anticipated. It was impressive to see the speed and accuracy of the photos taken also - many members of the team got a perfect photo within just a few shots. And best of all, the photos required virtually no editing. I would not hesitate in recommending River Studio to anyone, and we'll certainly be working with Richard again!",2023-12-08 10:16:20,en

I would highly recommend the studio , and Richard's services to anyone.",2018-12-03 12:11:25,en
