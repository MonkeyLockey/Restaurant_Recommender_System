The food was that good, we surprised ourselves by finishing it all off and not taking any home with us like we normally do.

There was that traditional desi pub ambience, but it was surprisingly quiet for a city centre eatery. I was there from before 7pm to after 8pm on a Thursday evening, and in that entire time there were only two other customers in there, who were just having a few drinks.

I rang them a few days beforehand and I was assured they use meat which is NOT produced in accordance with any religious faith. Sampled the veg mixed grill platter and was very impressed. Very tasty indeed.

Went to sample the food. The Saag was lovely and flavourful and the meat grill platter was also good. All in all, a nice mid week treat.

Used to be Jungle Bird before it closed permanently and saw that it’s now a new place so got curious and popped in for a drink. Didn’t eat so can’t comment on the food. People are super friendly though and love seeing a selection of beer on draft that you don’t tend to see elsewhere. A chilled place to hangout and watch a bit of sport. Will 100% come back to try the food. Fabulous wraps and masala chips - had a peel at the next tables curries -they also looked brilliant, lovely friendly staff. Hopefully this place will get as popular as their old premises - it was a bit lacking in atmosphere due to lack of customers - well worth trying and I’m sure it will soon be a must go to place. Quite a simple pub, serving excellent Indian food, with good service.
The menu is board and each item I had was good in it's own right. They were happy to customise the grill to my taste, and enquired if it was fine.
Good job. Its a busy place booking a table would be smart. I came here with a group of my friends and family about 20 of us for a get together for his pre wedding party , and considering how busy and packed it was they was still able to get a table for us  20 people and rearrange tables for us . The service and staff was outstanding and amazing and really welcoming also I’ve been to many bar & mix grill places and this probably has to be one of the top 10 by far in Birmingham that I’ve been to . They have a really good selections of beers and ales and also ciders , and quality  selection of the spirits from top spirits to standard classics , also a great mix of shooters . I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves a mix grill and curries the flavours of each one honestly is spot on all thanks to the amazing chefs .",1.0,0.0,"[""Indian"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Ethiopian""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['grill', 'mix grill', 'grill platter', 'mix', 'mixed grill', 'spirits', 'curries', 'platter', 'mixed', 'popped']","[""Ethiopian"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""spirits"", ""Service"", ""mix"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""grill platter"", ""curries"", ""mix grill"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""mixed"", ""grill"", ""mixed grill"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Fast Food"", ""platter"", ""popped"", ""Indian""]"

Held a corporate event here and can't fault the service provided by Liam and the team. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a function venue in the centre of Birmingham. The only warning I would put out is don't park in the multi storey campus car park which I did by mistake as there is free venue parking at weekends... Multi storey is £25 to park here on a Sunday afternoon. Thankfully Liam sorted this out for us but I was stunned at the rate being demanded.

As for the Pavilion, as a said - staff were all very helpful and friendly. The food was great for both flavour and quantity. The room arrangement worked really well - bar area with separate room to sit and eat. Toilets were also within booked area so didn't have to go out to public space and that helped make  the event feel very private.

8 would recommend and use again.... The Bournbrook Pavilion is the University of Birmingham residence hall that is closest to the university. And it is situated in the Selly Oak village. Selly Oak is known as a student town. A variety of student eateries and stores are within walking distance. The hostel is close to Aldi, Tesco, and Sainsbury's supermarkets. Bournbrook Pavilion is about 300-200 metres away from the University of Birmingham. Nice simple food, cost effective lunch, quick service and nice staff.

I visited the area on a sunny Saturday when it was very busy - cafes were packed and there was also an artisan market doing a roaring trade. Fab area. Visited the coffin museum and the jewellery shops.  Great vibes, lots of eateries and coffee shops. A place of men wandering on their own through a jungle of shiny things, looking a bit lost. Having said that, this is the place to go to get a good value, quality engagement ring. I ended up going with a bespoke shop elsewhere for the ring design but I bought the diamond in Birmingham. Although some are a little pushy, most of the shop assistants have the right level of patience to deal with (largely) men who just want the experience to end.

My advice to engagement ring shoppers would be to look around for half hour or so and then console yourself with a beer in one of the conveniently located pubs! Wonderful place and experience! Loads of expert independent jewellers and valuers.

It was my first time and I loved it here definitely will be back soon. The portion sizes are big worth the price aswell. Great customer service. We had a lovely family meal at Vietnamese Street Kitchen and really enjoyed the experience overall. The atmosphere was lively and welcoming, with stylish décor that gave a nice modern twist to traditional Vietnamese vibes.

The food was flavourful and well-presented, though it did take a bit of time to arrive. Prices were a little on the higher side for a casual meal, but the quality of the food made up for it.

For starters, my wife and I shared the chicken mango salad and duck dumplings. Both dishes were fresh, full of flavour, and nicely balanced — a great way to start the meal. The kids were happy with their chicken mains served with chips and salad — simple but tasty and well portioned.

For mains, I went for the Bun-Cha-Ha-Noi, which included fresh rice noodles, thinly sliced pork, king prawn meatballs, and a traditional spring roll. It was a delicious combination of textures and flavours. My wife had the grilled lemongrass chilli chicken — flame-grilled thighs marinated in a fragrant chilli blend — and she really enjoyed the spicy kick.

Overall, a great spot for something a bit different. We’d return again, especially for the unique flavours. Great service and amazing food. We were served quickly, and the food was really high quality with fantastic flavour. Recommend trying the cocktail of the month, this month's was great! We thoroughly enjoyed our night out at the Vietnamese Street Kitchen while attending an event in Birmigham. The food was delicious with lots of options and the staff were very helpful. The atmosphere was really good too. Will definitely be returning if we've business in Birmingham again We came here for lunch. We choose this place because there were plenty of vegetarian options.

The biggest down side was the service, the chef had to greet us because no-one else was available, after we were sat down no-one came to take our drinks order and when I went to ask I was surprised when the guy sat at the bar picked up a tablet and offered to take my order, he looked like a customer!
All in all it was ok but not sure I’d repeat the experience. Dessert was amazing though. I went for the Bottomless Belt today, and it was my first time visiting. No complaints about the quality of the food, which was made to a high standard. However, a member of staff clearly told me that I could order select items like gyoza, katsu curry etc off the menu as part of the bottomless belt.

Unfortunately, when I came to order these items, another member of staff apologised and said the policy had changed, and I would only have the cold options on the belt. This left me disappointed, as I wouldn’t have the same experience I could’ve had months earlier. In addition the belt options were basically variations of the same thing. Salmon on rice (nigiri), salmon in rice (futomaki) or salmon on its own (sashimi). I saw Edamame once (I managed to nab it), and waited almost an hour for desserts to roll out.

When it came to settling my bill, I was almost overcharged by £10 on the service fee, something I was not made aware of beforehand either online or in person. When I politely contested the charge, it was edited before my eyes to £2.25. Even this amount was too much, as I only wished to pay £29.95. Considering the mistakes made, I did not believe a service charge was warranted.

All in all, this experience has dissuaded me from bringing my family here in the future, and I hope you can look into some of these issues as it may hinder return visits. The food was great and the experience and people are amazing only thing I’d say is bring some water and service one in the session was slow for us but the food and making experience is beginner friendly and memorable The staff here are friendly and their service is excellent. Food is good but portions are small, so you buy more then suddenly it's very expensive... But if you can do maths before you order, then you will probably enjoy it here. Overall the food is very good. It's always fresh and tasty but the portion sizes are small and quite expensive. It's very nice for a special occasion or a light lunch.

The restaurant is clean and tidy and the food is easy to order via the QR code.

It's well worth a visit if you like Japanese Food but be prepared to be hungry an hour after you eat

All the side dishes were okay , some where good ,some not that great especially the middle gravy chicken .

Appreciate the authentic recipes. If you are a fan of Ethiopian food ,you would enjoy the experience . Lovely food and very warm service. Felt like I was stepping out of Birmingham straight into Ethiopian culture. Really interesting to learn about Ethiopian food and we all (including our 12 and 13 year old children) thoroughly enjoyed the food. The coffee which was roasted on site was amazing !

This is my first time ordering from this place, never again! As a fellow Asian seeing the turmeric colour on the “biryani” is bright enough to make a grown man cry. The poultry was undercooked the meat & chicken, the prawns were inedible impossible to bite into! This is not biryani this is fried rice!! It is very yellow they gave a lot of turmeric to it. I’m afraid if we eat it, it will cause a very bad health risk me and my family are very disappointed will not be ordering from this place ever again! We’ve had to chuck the so called biryani in the bin.
I should have listened to the negative reviews about this place before I ordered. tasty food nice interior decor lively place with great prices. Birayni is a must, the chicken peices were big soft and succulent. Staff super friendly. Super friendly staff, delicious food. Due to quite specific dietary restrictions there is only one curry I can eat but I don’t mind, I’ve had it about 7 times and will have it again. I love the whole experience like the hot towelettes and after eight mints provided at the end. Reasonably priced. Would appreciate a few more vegan options. After long time had such delicious south indian food. It was lovely experience with awesome food, excellent service and clean place.

Special mention to Anmol, she was great and made sure we are served well with hot dosas, puri’s and other stuff without making wait for too long.

But the coffee… wow!! The regular flat white is a full cup of coffee… and better tasting than your chain coffee houses!! Straight after getting off the train at Birmingham New Street yesterday, I popped into Grand Central Kitchen for some breakfast. Gotta say, I’d never had eggs and cheese like that before – absolutely delicious!
The staff were so friendly too. Special shout-out to the Iranian girl who was lovely, and the bloke (can’t remember his name!) who recommended some spots for me to check out in Digbeth. Loads of cool places to explore, so thank you both for the tips!
To be honest, I was a bit knackered when I came in and probably could’ve done with a nap right there and then. If I hadn’t been so tired, I’d have been even more buzzing about it all, haha. Anyway, cracking little spot – I’ll definitely swing by again next time I’m in Birmingham. Matee, I'm minging. Bloody love yaouw' 🤣 This is a great spot for classic cafe breakfasts. We had the Full English and the house omelette and both were super tasty. The restaurant itself is simple, the tables are quite close together but it runs like clockwork! Staff are super friendly and made us feel so welcome. Portions are generous, food is delicious and turnover is fast. A great experience! I had a meal at Grand Central Kitchen recently, and overall it was okay. The prices were fair, especially for the central location, which I appreciated. The staff were friendly and service was quick.

That said, the food itself didn’t quite hit the mark for me. The dishes looked good, but were missing a bit of flavour – just felt like they needed a bit more seasoning or something to bring them to life. I’ve definitely had better meals elsewhere in Birmingham.

Still, it’s not a bad spot if you’re nearby and need a bite – clean, convenient, and decent value. I’d give it 4 stars overall, mostly for the service and price. What an amazing place. Staff is so friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, cannot fault this place. 10/10 for me.

Popped in for a coffee and purposely charged me for a regular instead of a large, which honestly made my day.  I went back less than an hour later for a dine in breakfast.

Very welcoming and attending! Overall we had a good time. 👌🏼 It was a lovely experience to feel authentic Spanish foods. But I hope they can launch lunch specialised menus as well. We ate splendidly at Don Diego’s last night, with every single dish being extremely flavoursome. The house wines were good and the service was great. We were a bit put off by there only being three tables of guests on a Thursday night but alphonso and Edoardo said that they struggle to cook more than that number of covers.  I’m sure this is because each dish is an impressive amount of work and is prepared fresh.
Some of the food was exceptional. A huge shout out for the lamb cannelloni, the crab starter, the lamb meatballs, the tagines and the Semifredo. All 7 of us left very very well fed.

First impressions, the location is lovely and once you've found the secure car park it is really convenient getting to the centre.

The room was lovely and well decorated. However it was so hot the thermostat said it was 27 degrees! We couldn't get the air con to circulate cold air and didn't have a fan. We left the 3 windows open which were on the ceiling as we were on the top floor. However when we got back the room had filled with leaves from the trees above making a mess everywhere!

So we had to sleep with the windows partially open and extremely hot. Then in the morning the birds made a lot of noise which continued when we shut the windows.

For the price I do feel it was quite expensive. But it was a lovely hotel and had a great location with parking. This was a great hotel a few years back but it's very different now and I didn't feel particularly safe staying there. The only time I saw any staff was when checking in and you now have to phone a number to talk to ""reception"" who are off site.

When my key card failed, the reception gave us the code to a keybox to obtain one of their master keys that could open any door in the hotel. It was quite unnerving knowing that any other guest could get into any room, especially as the  deadbolt on the door to my room did not work. With no staff on site, other guests were also unchallenged when arguing loudly near my room.

The fire alarm was also sounding on the second night of my stay and showing a fault code. When calling reception  they struggled to understand the issue and said they had finished for the day and wanted me to send an email so that someone else could deal with it! Someone did come, but they only silenced it rather than sorting whatever the fault was.

Whilst the rooms are still nice and the location is good, there was a skip outside the hotel and I genuinely thought it had closed down when I first arrived. There is no longer a restaurant/bar either as that is now a separate business.

With a little work this could be a great hotel again but the lack of staff and resulting safety issues would really put me off staying again. What a fantastic place. It is beautifully clean and well presented. The staff have been amazing. They accommodated for Parking my van and explained everything for the room, WiFi and Room service. I will definitely come here again. The metro has made this the place to be for a returning Brummy. The rooms are huge and the bath is divine as you can see from the pic. We will be back This modern hotel was a perfect find for us as we needed to be on Birmingham University Campus for a couple of reasons. We were welcomed warmly and were very impressed by the hotel facilities and architecture. Our room was very spacious, comfortable and air conditioned too, so perfect! En-suite and whole hotel was spotlessly clean and clearly well maintained. Evening meals in the bar were excellent, as was the service. Breakfast in the main restaurant was a buffet style, again, with excellent food and service. Really recommend and rate this hotel, and the whole experience.

I've had good food in my life but this place is next level good.  From the story of the meals to the outright explosion of creative flavor you cannot go wrong by eating here.  When you come here it's an experience your stomach and soul will thank you for.  Do not expect to order off the menu but instead let the owners guide you on almost religious palette experience.  We had boar, venison, fallow deer, and everything was exceptional.  Thank you Rav and Jaz for sharing this with the world. A Sunday Roast Like No Other at The Goat King

If you think you’ve experienced the best Sunday roast, think again—because Rav and Jas at The Goat King have completely redefined the game. Their take on the classic roast, elevated with rich, flavorful saag, was nothing short of sublime. Every bite was a masterclass in balance, depth, and creativity. The meat was perfectly cooked, the saag was velvety and packed with warming spices, and the roast trimmings were spot-on.

The service matched the food—warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. Rav and Jas not only brought their culinary expertise to the table but also their passion and hospitality, making the experience feel both elevated and personal.

And the atmosphere? Effortlessly cool, with a buzz that made it feel like the place to be on a Sunday afternoon. Comforting, vibrant, and full of good energy—just like the food.

Already planning my next visit. If you haven’t been, go. And if you have—you know exactly what I’m talking about. If only all restaurants we're able to provide food of this quality with the personal service that Rav provides. The food exudes flavour that has you crying out for more, even if you are unable to finish the plentiful portions.  This restaurant is a hidden gem run by a culinary goat King 👑 Went for the first time last Friday & my friend and found the restaurant welcoming & unassuming and the portions large!

We both had the same starters and mains, as follows:

Starters"" Fritters of Desire"", consisting of Paneer, Feta , Halloumi, red onion, spinach, cauliflower, aubergine and potato tossed in masala mix fried in chickpea batter.

Ingredients were fresh and very tasty even if the portions were probably twice as large as needed!

Mains: The Goat King Special

Their signature dish, made of slow-cooked pulled goat curry served on and off the bone. Flavored with aromatic spices and herbs to enrich the meat and marrow to succulent perfection.

Served with rice and 2 soft, fluffy fritters, called  'Bhatura' which is a deep-fried leavened sourdough bread originating from the Indian subcontinent.

The goat was beautifully cooked and perfectly seasoned and was definitely some of the best meat I've eaten in any type of restaurant!

The light, rice infused Flying Buffalo Indian lager complimented the goat perfectly.

Rav, the owner/main chef and his wife are really friendly and Rav took time to sit with us & explain a bit about Sikh history and the importance of the food to their culture.

100% recommend The Goat King (also known as 24 Carrot Gold) for anyone wanting a change to their usual curry or mixed grills so popular in Birmingham's many Desi pubs!

Note: the food is totally non halal I’ve spent hours here, literally. First found the place after stepping out of the fine dining gaff next door. The smell of curry in the air had us like the Pied Piper, straight through the door and into what’s become one of my favourite places to eat.

It’s not flashy or trying to be something it’s not, just a proper family-run spot, the kind where you feel welcome the moment you walk in. No menus, no fuss, just whatever's bubbling away in the kitchen (and Rav's head!) that day. You sit down and dishes just start arriving, cooked fresh and full of depth.

I’ve been three times now. Twice with my mate and once with my family for my Fathers Day treat, and each visit has been different but equally memorable. The slow-cooked wild boar shoulder is unreal, but the goat curry is the real star for me—unctuous, rich, and perfect with rice and bread. I’ve not tried the veggie options, but everything else I’ve had has been banging.

You’ll see couples drop in for date night and families for dinner. Some pop in for something quick, fast Indian food and a drink, maybe a break mid-shop. But for me, it’s a place to settle in. We tend to stay for hours, let the small plates roll out, and soak it all up. With a solid wine list to compliment the food, lager sourced from India brewed from Basmati rice and rare Indian spirits to warm and lubricate the pipes.

What really makes it though, are the chats. Rav & Jas often come over for a sit and natter. Proper candid, Chatham House Rules-style conversations—you cover everything from food to life and whatever else floats by. It’s rare that a place feeds both your stomach and your head like this.

If you like real food, real people, and a space that just lets you be...get yourself here. (pictured- Slow roasted Wild Boar)

Well maintained accommodation,  friendly and professional staff.

I was lucky enough to have a room overlooking the cathedral and I could hear the bells ringing.

The bed was as comfortable as the adverts claim. Breakfast and dinner were excellent. I visited last year for work and returned for leisure this month. I highly recommend this branch of the Premier Inn. A brilliant stay. Room is modern (although the TV could do with a little update) and super clean.

I stayed after a busy bank holiday weekend and although clean and tidy, it felt the bed making was perhaps rushed but still nothing to be picky about.

The aircon was amazing! Some of the best and quickest to cool a room.

The bed comfortable and the shower hot (although not the most amazing pressure).

It was quiet in the hotel and breakfast is down in the attached restaurant which I’ve reviewed separately. We visited the hotel 2 times, the location at the heart of Birmingham is perfect to move and visit around.
Rooms were very clean but the A/C wasn't working (at least properly) on our first visit but second time in a different room, it worked perfectly.
On both visits, the team were very helpful and friendly, whenever we had a problem or question they were very supportive especially Rajj who remembered us from the first time and helped us with check-In.
The view of the room in the second time, was overlooking the church so it was beautiful. First time, the view was other buildings roofs, which was okay for us. Room was affordable and comfortable.
Did inform staff that the extractor fan for bathroom wasn't working, so it was like being in the amazon rain forest for many hours post shower.

Location of the area does require you to have your wits about you approaching the night. I stay at this hotel everytime I come to Birmingham due to great rates and great central location.

There were dark curly hairs all over my bed and the walls were so thin I hear the racist guy next door, he was saying such vile things I felt sick. The path to the hotel is full of homeless people that harass you. The entry smelt like urine. They said they had air conditioning yet the hotel was so hot I had to use my little fan I brought. Absolutely would not recommend at all. Felt very unsafe there. Great location for the station.  Lots of places to eat, worth a little exploration to avoid the chain eateries.  Very warm inside, but the fan in the room kept things comfortable. Quite a bit of noise outside, but only to be expected in the centre of a major city. Prison-esque with sounds coming from rooms in all directions, and CCTV literally everywhere! Hotels with CCTV in every corridor and stairway immediately receive a 1-star rating from me because it is entirely appauling. Guests need the freedom to explore hotels without the stress of being watched by security - this is fundamental. Minor positive is that the 1st floor lounge can be a decent place for members of the public to relax/work. Need somewhere close to New Street station which this was. So location was good, trying to find the entrance was a bit worrying, as it's down a side alley and when you are a female with child in tow looking for somewhere safe, this is not the place.

It was dingy, the lift and stairs smelt to high heaven of lots of unpleasant smells...there was a very uncomfortable smell of what I believe was marijuana through out the hotel.

The path to the room (be stairs or lift), was extremely hot.

We luckily came back to the hotel early around 7pm, but there were people hanging around the entrance that appeared drugged up.

The noise from the street drummers was so loud into the room, that it was either close the window and boil or listen to the noise...whilst the drumming was acceptable the foul language of the other people on the street that continued through out the night and again early morning  around 4am (with window shut) was enough to disturb sleep. The noise was so bad outside, that we also heard the local law enforcement trying to break it up.

Then around 7am you could hear the next door room watching a law drama, it was loud enough that I could follow the whole show from the otherside of our room.

The room was small but also of a degraded quality, if I had realised the travel lodge was so close, I would have booked in there instead. The entrance to the hotel looked like a crack den, the rooms have no AC, rubbish was left everywhere in the room when I checked in, fake tan smeared across the bathroom (including the half used micro soap bottles) and to top it all off the bed was so uncomfortable I found it very difficult to sleep above the noise from the street below; there are no bones to throw for this hotel.

What a find. It’s not cheap, but that’s reflected in the location, venue, presentation of food and taste. And goodness, everything was delicious! We were a party of 6; our order consisted of the Medicine and various French toasts.

The only gripe is the fried chicken from one plate to another varied quite a bit in size. We don’t know whether one was more generous, or we were short changed on the other? A bit of consistency here wouldn’t go amiss.

Other than that, a perfect way to start a Sunday morning. They also allowed dogs too! Service was timely, the venue was beautiful with lots of plants, and everyone of us enjoyed our meal.
Can’t wait to come back. Well done! TLDR: I’d only recommend this place if you’re getting a pastry from the front. Long wait times (45+ mins) + no cooling system = not a great place to dine in.

Came here twice and had very different experiences.

When a friend and I grabbed a pastry from the front, we were served and seated right away, even moving to a booth when requested. The atmosphere was great and the interior is very aesthetic and appealing for social media. No complaints here.

When I came alone a few months later to order brunch, I had a 2/5 experience. First, it took around 5-10 minutes to be seated with no acknowledgment of the long wait time, even with several moments of eye contact with staff who didn’t seem very rushed, though this can be overlooked. Second, I waited over 45 minutes for my food (not a guess or overestimate) without acknowledgment of any sort. There was a period of around 15 minutes where nothing came out of the kitchen (I had a direct view of where the food exited).

During this wait time, it was increasingly apparent how uncomfortable the space was. There was no AC and the building has no windows to open. The only cooling system was a single fan, and with the many skylights, the restaurant felt like a greenhouse. Literally outside the restaurant was cooler than inside and that’s not an exaggeration.

The food itself was alright. I ordered the harissa benedict and the only qualm I have with it was that the eggs were almost hard boiled and not runny at all. There was a lot of chorizo on it and the mushrooms were great, however I don’t think I’d pay £14 for it again. The Medicine Bakery is a staple for those who brunch in Brum. The food is excellent. Well priced. Generous portions and overall delicious.

From street level up the stairs you are greeted with a take away counter for loads of baked treat and bread which look and smell amazing.

You then have a small hallway with bench seating where the coffee are made which did get a little congested as it’s so popular. We did book which I thoroughly recommend to not have to wait for a table.

The dining room is large. Bright and airy with high ceilings, loads of green succulents and gallery walls.  Current exhibition is a photography collection of black culture in the UK. Lots of bench style seating down the middle which means you may share the bench with others (something which never bothers me)

The service speed is what lets the venue down. The coffee is excellent but always takes a long time to come. This has been a consistent issue with all my visits. The food is delicious. Beautifully cooked and seasoned. Though offering black pepper from a mill and not powered would be expected in a place like this.

Overall it’s great with slightly nonchalant service. Book ahead and make sure you have a hearty appetite. I love medicine bakery so I was chuffed to find it open on new street just a walk away from the office!
Lunch was delicious! I was excited to have my usual fried chicken but they ran out!!??? Shockkkkk! But hey I got to try something new and went for Turkish eggs! Delicious and very healthy. Lovely space and atmosphere! There are individual tables and sharing tables so make a note of what you want on your booking if you’re fussy! First time here for breakfast .

I will also post a photo in video on my YouTube channel, called, Birmingham close up. A beautiful emporium for wine lovers.

I admit to not knowing my Schloer from my Bolinger. So what attracted me to Loki Wine & Deli? It was the bright lights of its humble deli counter and the promise of mince pies. At the small deli counter I could see the beautiful, yet straightforward, range of cheeses, hams and antipastos. These are more to complement the wines than a meal outright.
The wine is elegantly presented on its many wooden shelves around the perimeter of the shop. The wooden standing platform on the left hand side of the shop was well lit, displaying the more audacious drink varieties.

Watch out! This coffee shop is only for the people with access to the offices in the building - it’s not open for general public despite it showing on the map as open.

On 16 July I wanted to stop by for a cup of coffee and I was told by the building staff that I can only enter the premises if I have access to the building itself and that the cafe is not open to general public. It was very frustrating to make the way there only to find out I can’t go.

Please change the description and I will delete this comment. Great coffee and 10/10 service!

Dear Subway Management,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my disappointment regarding a recent experience at your Edgbaston location. During an emergency, I urgently needed access to the restroom. However, I was informed by your staff that I would first need to make a purchase in order to gain permission.

As a regular customer of Subway, I found this policy quite disheartening, especially during a time of genuine need. This experience has left me feeling undervalued as a loyal customer, and I am now considering boycotting Subway altogether.

I believe that customer service should prioritize the well-being of patrons, especially in emergency situations. I hope that you can address this matter and ensure that future customers do not face similar challenges.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Sincerely, Feedback on Visit to Store on 7th July at 8:00 PM

Dear Subway Team,

I am writing to share my recent experience at your store on 7th July around 8:00 PM. The store was quiet at the time, with only two or three other customers present. My wife and I had initially planned to dine in. While she was seated, a staff member wearing a black uniform approached us and asked her to change her seat in a very rude and unprofessional manner.

We found this behavior extremely disappointing and chose to leave and dine elsewhere. I still decided to use my Subway points to purchase water bottles, but the same staff member refused this as well, which added to our frustration.

I believe the individual in the black uniform might be the manager. If that is the case, I am genuinely concerned about how someone with such poor customer service skills is leading the team. Respectful and courteous behavior should be a priority, especially from management.

I hope this feedback is taken seriously, and the staff member is advised to treat customers with basic respect and professionalism in the future.

Thank you for your time and understanding. I brought a sandwich and fries from here on my way back from school because I didn’t have anything in the morning. There was a pregnant lady who served me she was nice but the waffle fries were undercooked, and she rushed to give it to me because there were other people waiting.

The sandwich wasn’t even toasted, even though I asked for it toasted. I’ve also got an upset belly because of this. I hate to write bad reviews, but this needs to be sorted. She had someone working with her, but they were just sitting at the back doing nothing.

The downfall of this place needs to be studied, because why is this being normalised? It’s disgusting. The woman was the most vile person ever ! Usually I order online and this was my first time going in person . She had no patience and was speaking and directing conversation to my partner rather than myself who was ordering the food . I was getting confused and she lacked any empathy. We were the only ones in the shop so it’s not like she didn’t have time to be able to be patient. Completely has put me off from ever going into a subway . No customer service at all . And when another member arrived she started speaking to her in another language and you could just tell they were speaking about us I came into the Broadway Plaza store first time. I asked for Potato Waffle fries. Omg it's the worst ever. Stale tasting and too soft. It was very horrible. Plus cookies are so expensive compared to other branches- £6 for 6 cookies!

I was the only vegan of the group and was well catered for. I was expecting to only end up eating salad and chips but lots of options on the salad bar. Impressive selection that is all labelled with allergens so you can clearly see whether it contains milk or eggs.

Staff went out their way to make a vegan friendly pizza for me. Worth the price for die-hard meat lover! The restaurant offers a variety of options, including steak, pork ribs, lamb, sausages, chicken wings and more. Some of these had a bloody taste that I don’t like but the amount of options they offer and the fact that this is an all you can eat buffet seems more important.

The waiter came around the table every 5 minutes with a new plate and were very generous.

In the self service station you can also find things like pasta and chicken bites. The service was nice. The salad bar has many options. However, the meat was so salty, especially chicken and pork. Lamb was nice and well seasoning. Th beef was great too. I can’t review the food because we only came for drinks. The cocktails are fantastic and not shy of booze. Our bar server whose name I think is Natalia is just the best! Great place to eat, variety of salad bar and meat. However you have to use 1 plate and there is no offer to clear plate away.

We has no reservation but were seated swiftly. They explained to us how we order which is online through a barcode. We ordered and the food came out within 30minutes. The food was great, filling and definitely to our standards. Visited during the half-term holidays for the all-in lunchtime buffet. It was absolutely crowded out, and I discovered why afterwards. They had a deal on for a free kids meal if you spend £10 or more. I hadn't seen this so I paid full price, which is my own mistake! It's a cashless venue, and you have to order off the QR code, or at least that's what I was told to do anyway.

I was very happy with the buffet as all of it was non-haallal so all options were fine for me. A decent selection of pizza varieties, my personal favourite was the 'nduja one. They do serve beer and wine but I stuck to the soft drink machine as it was included in the buffet. All of the staff were lovely, it's just how busy the place was and the queues where quite overwhelming, as well as lots of little kids running freely and popping up over our booth.

If you're a vegetarian, I'd exercise caution as I did see a child swap a ham pizza into the vegetarian section so although the best care is taken by the restaurant in the way they've set it up, they can't keep an eye on everyone during hectic times. It's hard to go wrong with Pizza Hut, and this place was no exception. Truly exceptional service from the gentleman working front of house this evening (Lyndon).

They didn't have any accessible rooms listed on their website but they upgraded us to an accessible room when our room's TV wouldn't work! Wheelchair accessibility was pretty good. Loved the inclusion of a pull cord by the bed in the accessible room! The cleaners added a lovely personal touch! Wonderful hotel with good value for money. The real stars of the show are the amazing staff. The most shining star by far Shesh who goes above and beyond to ensure guests are well cared for. Thanks for your hospitality, cleanliness, wonderful breakfast and overall positive attitude.

Location wise, the hotel is few min walk from all main attractions and train station. A great catch for anyone looking to explore the city. Great location.
Large room with a super king bed. Great shower.
The only downsides were the pillows weren't the most comfortable but were ok.
Perfect location (opposite New St station) and close to many bars and restaurants etc. However, just outside of the hotel was really run down and derelict.

The air con didn't work (wouldn't even turn on). When I informed reception, they said they'd try and fix it during the day, and that if they couldn't, then they'd move me to a different room. They didn't fix it and told me I couldn't move rooms as most of the rooms didn't have air conditioning working either. Poor for a large chain hotel (especially due to the fact it was the hottest days of the year so far). So uncomfortable to sleep. Nice hotel which is in a really good location with lots of bars and restaurants nearby. The room was a little small but very clean and modern. There’s not much room to hang your clothes either.

The menu boasts a wide variety of choices, catering to different tastes. I tried the fusion burger, which was absolutely delicious, though I found the portion a bit small as I finished it quite quickly.

This place is highly recommended, especially for families, thanks to its friendly environment. The only downside is the location—it’s tucked away in the city centre with limited free parking, which might be inconvenient for those coming from outside the area. However, it’s a great spot for students living nearby.

Overall, a solid choice for a tasty burger experience. Ordered a burger meal with curly fries, the food was nice, but the portions are really small for what you are paying. Unfortunately I left still wanting more food. Should increase the size of portions. Also would be good if they did grilled chicken with rice. Ordered a beef pizza and chicken grilled burger. It was nice but the chicken was such a tiny slice of breast it wasn't even a full breast which was really disappointing and the fries weren't the best at all, a bit dry. The shop looks nice and clean, the owner could be a bit more polite towards customers. We asked the guy aswell to have whatever is ready first either the burgers or the pizza he said ok but in the end he decided to leave the burgers sitting there rather then give them to us first as asked and agreed to and then the pizza Stopped by late at night after a rave and so glad we did.

For a venue with such a prestigious reputation, I expected much better value for money. We had food here last night (April 11th) and wow it was bloody delicious. We had the calamari and nachos to start my husband wishes he ordered more calamari it was that good my nachos was full of flavour all home made!

We always stay here if we have a show and the menu has just changed and it’s definitely worth a visit. Came here with my family and had to leave. The staff was extremely difficult and awkward to get a straight answer out of. When we turned up there were only two other tables but ended up having to wait about 40 minutes. I ordered a kids meal and it came with crisps but supposedly this took about 20 minutes to prepare, which I had to ask for as they had forgotten. We were given dirty knives and forks and when ask for a replacement they handed us they while touching the ends with their hands. We finally had to push them again were our food was and they brought out a undercooked frozen pizza. The base was soggy underneath and honestly the cheap ones from Aldi taste nicer than this. We could eat the food even though we were starving, ended up leaving as this was a poor excuse for an evening meal. If you're staying in the hotel, the breakfast was okay, I only had this as it was already paid for but honestly if you can avoid coming here please do so. Service was a little slow in the restaurant. Food and drink on the pricier side but it was good quality and tasted great. We would consider visiting again. A nicely designed posh interior to this modern continental restaurant part of the Holiday Inn hotel. A good breadth of options, we went for the afternoon tea. It was a basic afternoon tea then those you typically expect from a hotel but was wonderfully presented. The scone was warm. There were only 3 finger sandwiches and we weren't offered refills.

Kids are very welcome and obviously they will love the fries.

I had whopper (of course) because are the best fast food burgers. Burger King never disappoints when it comes to burgers. The flame-grilled patties have a distinct smoky flavor that sets them apart from the rest. Whether it's the classic Whopper or something more indulgent like the Bacon King, each burger is juicy, flavorful, and made fresh to order. The toppings are generous and well-balanced, with crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, pickles, and just the right amount of sauce. Plus, the buns are always soft and hold everything together nicely. If you're craving a reliable and tasty burger, BK hits the spot every time! The experience here as a whole was not great. They made the food quickly, however it was old meat and therefore barely warm and odd-tasting, the same with the fries. The milkshake I received had no syrup in and I had to ask 2 times for them to remake it. The first time I was waiting for ages at the counter for someone to come up and help me but I could see them all talking to each other in the kitchen, they knew I was waiting but decided to make me wait longer while they talked. The second time I went up for help, the man seemed extremely displeased with me and that made me uncomfortable.

Thank you! Went tonight for the karaoke and my friend sang on stage, some write offs (and I mean write offs) came in and were messing around on the stage she was singing on and recording here trying to take the piss. No security, nothing. I sang after her which was fine and when we left my friend told the boy who was very active in taking the piss that she wasn’t happy to which he started pushing me towards the bannister of the stairs and asking me to come outside. I kept composure otherwise I would have smashed his lights out and probably be banned from your club, but it would have been in defence. My friend is called Nabeela and I think you should check the cameras and work out the time my friend was on stage and get to the bottom of what happened and make sure he is banned from your premises. The lack of security on your part? Not good. Been in here quite a few times and always been ok but last night we went in , my friend ordered a vodka and Pepsi, and when he drunk it the taste of the drink was cheap rola cola so he went back to bar and said I thought this was Pepsi and the girl said it is Diel Pepsi so my friend asked for it to be changed and was given a small bottle of Coca Cola and charged an extra £2.20.

However, the service was disappointing. When we politely asked to change tables, the server responded with visible frustration and even raised their voice at us, making us feel like we were being scolded rather than served. It was uncomfortable and completely unnecessary. We were simply trying to enjoy some quality time together, but the staff's attitude made us feel rushed and unwelcome. It really detracted from what could have been a perfect dining experience. Came for the dinner buffet at half 5, we were seated and drinks orders taken straight away. Sooo much food to choose from, constantly being replenished. Really enjoyed it and will definitely be back soon! The buffet experience at your restaurant was sumptuous and explosive, having to try different kinds of dishes and finding the tastes so  perfect and delicious was lit for my partner and I .

The place has a vibrant, modern vibe with a wide variety of Asian cuisine options under one roof – perfect for trying something new or satisfying multiple cravings in one go.

We ordered Korean Fried Chicken, Chow Mein Noodles, Fried Chicken Dumplings, and Chicken Bibimbap – every dish was flavorful, fresh, and well-prepared. The Korean Fried Chicken in particular was crispy, juicy, and packed with flavor.

Overall, the entire food hall setup was clean, spacious, and buzzing with energy. Great for casual meals, group outings, or food-hopping adventures. Will definitely be coming back to try more! A market style food hall. Basically pop up shops with Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Thai food.
You have to purchase a charge card and then use that to pay. If you pay cash, you get any refund back, but if you nominate to pay by card then there is no refund.

I prefer the Japanese as I love my Sushi. It was really good. Reasonable prices and generous portions.

The beauty is you can choose whatever everyone wants and not restricted.

Plenty to choose from which is what will make you keep going back.

The places is slightly out of the way from most of the china town restaurant and up upstairs. We popped in to have some food here. The prepayment system is easy to use, and the staff helped us to have a card and top it up. There are different eateries with Korian, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Chinese food. The concept is perfect, the staff is friendly, the food is tasty, and we had massive portions. I will definitely visit when I visit Birmingham next time. The food options were good but the ordering system is unnecessary friction,  if you aren't local you're going to end up topping up a card to pay and having money leftover you can't use again.  You also have to browse around and plan what to order before topping up the card to make sure you  only top up what you want to spend.

If you pay cash you can get a refund but that's another unnecessary step before you can order food

The food and drink options were really varied and had some dishes I don't see very often on other menus. Beautiful food and good value, the portions were massive, we went to the second floor where the Japanese and Korean stall was.
The only thing is that you must top up a card instead of paying the vendors directly. You can get a “card” to put money on with either cash or card but if you do it by card then you cannot top it up again unless the transaction is over £5 ( I believe this sign should have been ON THE INSTRUCTIONS/GUIDANCE )
If you have money left over on the card you will not be refunded your £2 deposit for the card they’ve given you…

The Caribbean food they do was fairly and the set menu they had on for the festival meant it was really good value too. Their cocktails are also quite nice and the place has a good vibe. However, this was all detracted from by incredibly slow food service. I’m not sure if something was wrong in the kitchen but we consistently had to wait for around 30 minutes or more for dishes to be prepared. Some other customers left because of the delays. Recently came here with my partner and we had the sunday reggae roast, which absolutely blew us away!! The portion sizes were amazing. I've never felt so happy and full, we'd absolutely recommend and are excited to come again. My second time visiting but this time I ate and it was absolutely fantastic. The service was lovely and food was even better. Would definitely recommend and cannot wait to come back and do one of the quiz nights or anything else that’s going on 🫶🏾 Might have written a review already, but it is worth another.  Loving this place!  Food is really tasty and you can snack or have something more substantial if you wish.  The food trucks on the last Friday of the month are a great idea as well.  Good array of drinks - love that they had elderflower liqueur to go with my gin and it was great!  Wonderful relaxed atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff.  What's not to love.

Extremely happy customer. Store is too hot you in the day you need to put something on the Back Windows to block the sun out. Even use A/C went in today absolutely awful in here. Wanted to buy more but couldn’t possible stay any longer or even concentrate on what I was buying. I went to Aveda for my Scalp and hair analysis. The girl over there treated me so well. Checked my scalp and suggested me Scalp solution range which really helped me. I was quite happy with the service and her recommendation. Well trained and knowledgeable staff
Thanks Boots x I have been to this Boots many times, and I am usually very disappointed by the stock levels and in particular the amount of tester products available. Usually when I go to the makeup stands, I cannot try the products I want to as there are no testers available, and there are also only a few products available to buy. Often a few shelves are fully empty.
The queue time is also often very long, and there are often not many staff on the till, considering it is a busy shop. I have actually known the queue to get very long, but there still be no staff at all at the till point. (See photo for part of a queue on such an occasion).
It may seem strange that this largely negative review is attached to a 3-star review, however I must give credit to the lovely team members at the store, to the pharmacy staff for always being so helpful, for the well stocked pharmacy shelves and to the people who have given me vaccinations at the store in the past. I just want to raise the two big issues I have with the store, as they so often frustrate me! Lovely store with lots of great offers. Excellent customer service.

We had chicken Kotthu, Paneer Masala well cooked to perfection.

The food itself was lovely and flavourful I found the sauce too rich & flavourful for me and couldn't finish the whole portion due to the suace it was just the flavouring was slightly not to my preference but still beautifully made regardless, just personal preference fish cakes tasted amazing. They had a range of products for sale as well as bubble tea and drinks. Price point was good as well and nice table and chairs to sit on such a nice place to go will definitely be returning there in the future as it was a lovely experience and felt warm and welcoming and friendliness. Not far from the mail.box either.  10/10 would recommend. Also the chicken is Halal.as well as there being many veggie options on the menu. Cute little cafe + shop for all things korean or if you are looking for asian groceries. Had the nicest matcha latte here. Good for occasional iced coffee/matcha runs if you stay in Mailbox or nearby. The staff are so polite and nice. Place is really affordable and convenient. Very nice food and friendly staff. A great lunch time stop for anyone who enjoys Asian food. A lovely mix of Japanese & Korean fast food, snacks & drinks. Absolutely wonderful and friendly service. Thank you for letting my family and I wait at your cafe with our luggage while waiting to check into the apartment. ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Discovered this place while searching for shops selling for bubble  tea after visiting the Mailbox in Birmingham.

I really enjoyed it. The food was of good authentic quality with plenty to try and at reasonable prices too. Note that the menu online is out of date so they should update that. Drinks prices also very reasonable. Service could have been a little more organised and friendlier. Toilets were clean but they have a gap in the ceiling above for both genders so you can hear each other from the cubicles which I found weird. Overall we would visit again First time I ever went there to buy food, they tried robbing me off my money by including something I never ordered in my bill and they kept the receipt . And when I realised after paying over £20 for something I never ordered. They claimed it was a mistake and promised to refund me. They went further to ask for my account number. Thereafter, many days passed by without them refunding me , I kept calling and the manager kept frustrating me and refusing to transfer back my money.  Honestly, I was very disappointed in them. How could a restaurant play that kind of game with a customer. They thought I won’t be clever enough to ask for my receipt to see what I have paid for. Awesome west African food, been there a couple of times for takeaway meals and I have to say I will definitely go again! Portions are generous and tasty, cooked with fresh ingredients. I recommend the suya and the Ndole as they are my favourites. Assorted meat pepper soup is fantastic too full of fragrant flavours. Staff is really nice and helpful always get things right. A hidden gem in Birmingham! I ordered a simple chicken and rice meal with fried dumplings to take away  the order was ready after an hour and twenty minutes. I wouldn't have minded waiting if they were busy but there were only six people in the establishment and no one else was eating.

When I got the food home which is literally across the road, the rice was in a carton of grease and was not joloff rice which I ordered. When I cut into the oddly shaped pieces of chicken the meat was red at the bone and uncooked thoroughly.

I would not recommend and I will certainly never be going back.

Subway is my go-to spot when I want something quick, tasty, and made exactly how I like it. The ingredients are always fresh, especially the veggies, and I love how many choices I have—from the bread to the sauces. The staff is usually friendly and efficient, even during busy hours.

My favorite is the Chicken Teriyaki or the Veggie Delight with extra cheese and chipotle southwest sauce—highly recommend it toasted! It’s also a great option if you’re trying to eat a bit healthier without sacrificing flavor.

Clean environment, quick service, and reliable taste. Can’t go wrong with Subway! I’ve been looking forward to trying [tuna] at [subway ] for awhile now, and was so glad that I did! The food was so delicious and the service was really great, too!” Appreciate to our boy thats to good mate We mainly went here l knew they did gluten free bread. I had chicken, salad
Dairy free cheese which they then toasted
It was nice. Not cheap good to have this option very little places do gluten free/dairy free. More choice would be nice

I gave 3 for service only because 2 people at the same time were asking me what fillings l wanted in my roll so it just ended up being confusing when it shouldn't been. Other than that it was fine Not clean,  low quality and not customer oriented....He does not even wrap the sandwiches,  just throwing them in tray and  as the sauce and inside is out in tray...

Could benefit from more plug sockets for customers at the tables. Needs more vegan food options, sweet and savoury. Stopped here for tea, coffee and cakes on a wet Monday morning. Service was polite and efficient. The 'raspberry and almond bake' was delicious - but rather small for the £2.85 price tag. And 25p dearer than at my local Costa!! *WARNING* Use this Costa Coffee Branch INSTEAD and DONT use the Costa Express Machine across the road at that Tesco (Frederick St) That machine at Tesco is DIRTY, the spill tray is never emptied & has floating mould, it’s never cleaned & wonder why it’s slightly cheaper. Although the shop may cost a few pennies more, the coffee is better quality, better taste & is fresher.
My review:
Soon as you walk in Costa Coffees doors, it’s clean, pristine & pleasant smelling. It will either be almost empty or it’ll be where you can hardly find a seat - depending whether it’s peak times or not. Try to avoid going at peak times/rush hour (like when JQ offices/shops close for the day around 4-5pm). It has a warm, casual, calm vibe. Not like the City Centre chaos of ‘keep your handbag close’ type energy. Store is large, bright and welcoming. There’s usually 1-2 members of staff on so you’re served pretty quickly. (Ensure you scan your Costa Card & get those beans & free drinks!) Menu is high up and easily readable. Ask if you’re not sure/want something custom. It’s their job to assist you & you’re paying so don’t feel shy. Much more menu choices than the Express machines. Regular promotional items come & go (which I love) but they don’t last forever so get them quick! Usually a courteous manner from staff, prompt speed for serving you your drink, served without spillages, lid tight & my custom requests are honoured. Condiments area near to counter, it’s clean & well stocked with all items labelled clearly. This is usually where notices are regarding allergens, recycling info & store info; as well as the bin which I’ve never seen full or overflowing. Lots of seating but I chose to leave with my drinks every time. Big windows to view out of to see Frederick St (retail units, Car Paks complex, Chamberlain Clock & the mini roundabout it’s on) Parking is available right outside, 3-4 spots. This is free after 6pm to 8am & all Sunday, otherwise around £1.50. Pay at machine or RingGo app. Same nearby (Eg Warstone La & Vyse St). There’s Vyse St Multi Storey car park 2min walk away adj to the P.O. It’s technically the same road, just named different as it’s over the mini roundabout. Pricing is about the same & pay the same ways. Best to pay on the App as you can easily extend, not have to worry about finding change nor risk a ticket. I’ve never checked if there’s toilet facilities. I wouldn’t advise making reservations/pre ordering for collection unless it’s a very large order. You’re just going to get cold drinks. Although I’d say it’s kid friendly, it’s not a place for kids (it’s a place for coffee drinkers - which are 100% adults). So unless you have super young babies who just sleep 99% of the time in a pram/holster, very well behaved children or you’re only in for a collection therefore short periods eg - I wouldn’t advise bringing in kids. It’s a place that serves scolding hot liquids that customers set down on tables…. I don’t think you’d want your child/children running around that. Not the place. Pricing is much better than Starbucks by far, & slightly better than Tim Hortons. Prices are not as good as McD’s but DEFINITELY miles better than their quality. Service here meets Costa’s standards overall. I’ve seen better service for Costa in other locations but it’s not bad at all. Wheelchair/scooter friendly as no steps outside, it’s a flat ramp only. They also offer alternatives to dietary requirements. Giving 4/5 for service as I have been left waiting a few times when it’s been empty yet staff finish cleaning up/tending to coffee machines behind the counter/tables etc while I’m at the counter waiting to order. Nothing serious but after 2 minutes, it’s a little rude. Otherwise an excellent branch that no doubt sees 1000’s of customers per week in such a popular area like JQ. Yet still manages to maintain Google star rating of nearly 5. I will be returning to this branch. Recommended Very conveniently located, clean and inviting store with attentive staff.

The mocha is the best for a quick sweet pick me up! Visited this costa for a drink with friends. The service was very quick and staff were polite. Plenty of choice of different seating areas, however the air-con was quite strong on a fairly cool day, meaning the seating areas around this were uncomfortably cold, so we had to move to another table.",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Special Occasion""]","['costa', 'st', 'better', 'roundabout', 'coffee', 'machine', 'better quality', 'customers', 'counter', 'info']","[""counter"", ""customers"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""Dessert"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""machine"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""info"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""roundabout"", ""costa"", ""better quality"", ""better"", ""Special Occasion"", ""Value"", ""coffee"", ""st"", ""Experience""]"

I have always found the care home staff to be very welcoming and friendly.   A very clean, caring environment and everybody appears to be well looked after.  I would be most happy to recommend this care home to anybody. Celia, my Mother, started living in this fabulous care home a few months ago and couldn’t be happier.
She has been cared for in every way possible and is thriving for it. The staff, especially Zsungai and Ethel,  are constantly attentive to her needs.
She has established solid friendships with the other residents, which is a real bonus. She went into the home weighing only six stone, having been extremely unwell and in hospital for several weeks with a serious stomach issue.
The change in my Mum is remarkable, so thank you too to Rebecca who looks after my Mum’s diet.
Thank you.
Helena Nesbitt amd the rest of the family. This morning I have had the pleasure of attending Edgbaston Beaumont in a professional capacity. It has been a pleasure meeting the homes general manager Sarah and her staff, I can not praise ALL the staff highly enough for the care and dedication they give to their residents is second to none. All the staff are friendly and very knowledgeable about their residents. I could not fault anything about this home. I base this on many homes I visit in my average working day. I attended Edgbaston Beaumont Care Home to carry out educational training. When I arrived, I was made to feel welcome straight away. The Care Home is very well presented, hidden behind beautiful gardens that the rooms over look. All of the staff were very engaging and focused on quality of care first when discussing best practise. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and I would personally like to thank the manager Debi for her support! One of the best care homes I've been to. First placement for a 1st year student and my experience was amazing. All the staff were so friendly and supportive, I immediately felt like part of the team. RGN Florence was my mentor and is one of a kind. A kind, bubbly teacher with heaps of patience. The management team run and maintain the nursing home with professionalism and offer the residents with quality care showered with a great sense of a homely feel for them. Edgbaston Beaumont is clean and spacious. The food is amazing!! But most of all, the patient -centered care being delivered is exceptional.

Nice location by the canal, impressive decor, mostly great, friendly service, but I will always remember this as the place where I first broke the £8 barrier for a pint! Also, we were told the coffee machine was broken, so no flat white for the wife, who settled for a Pepsi Max. Great food and service, order from your table or go up, whichever suits. We didn't book but got a table and the food and cocktails were great. We weren't rushed; we were able to stay and chat without any pressure, which was great on a Saturday afternoon. The music was a tad on the loud side for me as we wanted to talk, but it was upbeat and complemented the positive vibe. Good views of the canal and plenty of outdoor seating as well as inside. Had a bottomless brunch with some friends on Saturday. The food was lovely, the cocktails flowed.... Again lovely.... But the highlight was our server Jasmin.... She was fabulous and really looked after us. The manager was also a lovely lady..... So pleased we booked for this lovely afternoon As I approached All Bar One I instantly knew I would have an amazing evening. I can say I was not disappointed.

Thank you Joanna for making it a well worth evening out. Great meal in a nice pub. We enjoyed the deal that was on, the after work squad.

The restaurant is beautiful inside very clean and minimalistic. We were welcomed by Lucy who was amazing throughout the whole dinner. She made sure we had a lovely time and was friendly and cheerful but professional at the same time.
The restaurant offers a tasting menu and plenty of drinks options including a wine pairing.
Every single dish was unique on its own way and had some amazing flavours. In addition, each dish was beautifully presented. Some of my personal favourites were the Wye valley asparagus with exmoor caviar and whey sauce, a simple dish but with some unique and delicious flavours. Another favourite was the A5 Wagyu beef with grilled chicory.
There is an option to add a cheese selection before moving onto desserts and it was absolutely worth it, some delicious British cheeses with home made crackers, apple preserve and home made malt loaf.
The desserts were absolutely beautiful and tasted incredible. The sourdough cake with rye custard and brown butter ice cream was loved by everyone on the table. The petit fours at the end were the perfect finish of an amazing dinner. The sunflower seeds macarons and freshly baked madeleines were delicious. The madeleines are baked to order and still warm when served.
We even had a chat with Ben- the chef who makes all the amazing food, he was lovely.
Overall we had an amazing experience with some beautiful food and Lucy and Ben who run the restaurant made sure we felt welcomed and provided us with amazing food and exceptional service.
Definitely recommend! The whole experience at Restaurant Folium was of an outstanding class. It’s a very small and intimate setting, with one room, a central bar/barista/service area, and a kitchen with large glass window - almost open plan.

The menu is seasonal, with different tasting courses being available depending on time of the year, and produce availability. There is no choice of courses though, but that’s standard for a tasting menu.

Without spoiling the current tasting menu too much, the cod roe starter was incredibly moreish, the custard and roast chicken course was an amazing combination, and the sous vide wagyu steak… well, no words!

Whilst Folium doesn’t have a Michelin star (yet! Surely one must be coming?) it compares incredibly well to those restaurants in the area that do, and should be included in the same category.

Highly recommended, and I’m sure I will be back. Fantastic experience for my birthday. My girlfriend was kind enough to take me here to celebrate and I wasn’t disappointed. The staff were fantastic and the food was outstanding. A real feast for the eyes, nose and mouth. If you like fine dining this is fabulous. Came her for the long tasting menu and what an incredible experience it was. 15 courses of some of the best food I've ever eaten. The texture and the flavours were mind blowing. The desserts we had were better than all the Michelin star restaurants in Birmingham. The experience was brilliant and the staff were great. I will definitely be back for the food but the desserts were amazing. We were lucky enough to walk in and grab a table on Saturday night after a cancellation. The food was fantastic, so much attention to detail in both flavour and presentation. The cod in crab butter was a personal highlight but every dish was noteworthy. We also had the wine pairing which was thoughtfully chosen and enjoyable and very much enhanced our meal.

Called to complain to be fair did ask if we wanted fresh food at this point I refused and returned all food back to restaurant for refund, upon return owner asked for the curry sauce back??? Did he want me to scrape it off the food? bizarre, such a shame as order from here regularly and have been a customer for years. I wont order again. I ordered from
This place for the first time and I was really impressed with their service, food quality and my overall experience.
The portion size was amazing, I had plenty of extra meat like I asked for, food arrived pipping hot and I’d definitely recommend them Tried again since reverting back to Jade House menu and it was as good as before. Will definitely be our go to Chinese takeaway again. Ribs were especially good 👍 After previously saying I wouldn't be attending this newly refurbished takeaway and menu, after they'd removed the only vegan tofu dish. I was delighted to see that they'd added it back to their menu and the food is just as delicious 😋

These dishes are consistently well prepared, delivering rich, authentic flavors that leave a lasting impression. Additionally, the naan breads are a true highlight, striking the ideal balance between fluffy and crisp.

They even came to check on me later so caring and attentive towards the guests. I also love how there are childrens art work on the wall i didnt notice until leaving but I love how they got children involved in the decor Based on price/product (all round), the Briar Rose is absolutely exceptional in every way. We were here on Sunday evening, a really lovely, spacious, bright yet cosy double with everything that you need on hand, all for £39 for God's sake.
The welcome at reception was just fantastic (from Vanessa I recall her name being?), who was lovely and couldn't do enough. The room (502) has a large bath (the bathroom is great, really decent size) and massive deep sink.
There's an iron and ironing board, hairdryer l, a big fan (it was a warm day) and teas, coffee, hot chocolate and bottled water (with biscuits) all in the price. Beautifully comfy double bed too and a decent sized wall mounted tv.

This place is absolutely spotless too.

The staff are all super nice and the service is kind and efficient.

Honestly, I'm amazed at how brilliant it all is fornthe almost free price. I cant praise it highly enough - we love it so much we've booked another night (41 quid).

Ooh, the bar area too - again, flawless. Great service, nice staff, the bar is perfect, it just screams ""well managed"". The Freedom breakfast is the best £3.99 you're ever going to spend. If you're looking at staying in Birmingham, dont bother looking anywhere else (unless you're looking for spa's and 5 star etc). Pound for Pound, this is the best hotel in Birmingham. Have I been in ""better"" hotels? Course I have, I've lived in several countries, I've stayed in plenty of 5-star hotels, but for the price, its phenomenal.",1.0,0.0,"[""Japanese"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Dessert"", ""Breakfast""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone""]","['spoons', 'honestly', 'room', 'pound', 'amazed', 'wall', 'hotels', 'price', 'brilliant', 'double']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Service"", ""wall"", ""Breakfast"", ""Dessert"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""double"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""honestly"", ""room"", ""Portion Size"", ""Japanese"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""price"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""amazed"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""spoons"", ""hotels"", ""Value"", ""pound"", ""Experience"", ""brilliant""]"

Not nice Went to Costa today at Selly Oak, I was shocked to see the two staff supposedly serving to be messing around with each other, slapping each other and acting like children. The one member of staff was seemingly paying no attention to food hygiene, although she wore gloves, touched everything including a bin. I am glad I had a food straight from a packet. Tables were unclean and my tray stuck to the table, good job I had my own antibacterial wipes. I won’t be going  back again, I very much like Costa coffee but certainly wasn’t impressed at this branch, was a let down. The shop is nice, bright and airy. It has nice decors throughout. Staff were friendly and accommodating. I even got a free cookie as the first one she gave me is broken which is quite nice. I had a wet cappuccino and it was as I want my coffee to be. I love the atmosphere of the shop a bit busy but with the right amount of buzz going. The staff here were very friendly and welcoming today, there were so many young kids being allowed to run around the shop, one of the staff members did intervene when one of the kids started messing about with items in the fridge, which i thought was correct for her to do. People really do need to control their own kids, there were several playing around behind the door, the door is very heavy and any one of the kids could of been hurt, through no fault of the staff.
Anyway, thank you ladies, keep doing what you're doing xx Really Can not fault the service, the atmosphere, the staff are always cheerful 😃

Every time we are on route to work we grab a coffee here or have a meeting here.

The staff are so welcoming. You are always able to grab a vegetarian / vegan option hot or cold meal snack.

There is always something in  the fridge, we know we will get fed 👍🏻

Here there are only 2 members of staff working hard, good service amazing attitude. Constant customer flow this store needs recognition it’s always like this. Always happy to accommodate always.

I ordered the chicken sadwich with fries and some water.  Took about 5 mins for them to put it on the table luckily it wasnt busy at all.

The sandwich tasted amazing, the only complaint is I wish they gave more coleslaw. I will definetly be back This place is truly a hidden gem! The service was excellent, and the atmosphere struck the perfect balance - neither too empty nor too crowded—allowing us to relax and stay for quite some time. With plenty of waitstaff, service was prompt, and tables were cleared quickly.

As for the food, we both opted for pasta dishes, and they were absolutely delicious. To top it off, we indulged in kunafa with strawberries covered in chocolate. Fair warning - if you don’t have a sweet tooth, you might want to skip it because it’s INCREDIBLY rich and indulgent!

I’d definitely return and have already recommended this spot to a few friends. Been here a few times. It’s a very nice and affordable place to go out with friends in city centre. The foods always been great. The only downside is the long waiting time after being served. Firstly I always walk past to go to work and
Always wanted to try!!! I was unimpressed 😒 sorry service was not good at all!

This has to be the worst Nando’s in Birmingham absolutely disgusting!

I ordered half a chicken on the Nando’s app and although I phoned the restaurant and put it in the notes to give me two legs instead of a breast they gave me a breast .

It gets worst they gave me cold,old ,eaten food the wing on the breast look eaten and i think it was done intentionally because I requested two legs .

I ordered peri tamer and you can’t even taste it tasted like plainish .

I spent over £20 for eaten food plus there was no tissue ,sauce or cutlery in the bag .

If you come to Birmingham just go to new street Nando’s this Nando’s is rank and nasty do not eat or order from here!

If you ever order from this Nando’s and you want to add or change anything don’t even bother they will intentionally mess with your food Service we received didn't just make this another chain visit, but left us feeling like we'd been to a family restaurant. Dan was amazingly engaging. Also, Perinaise, what a find! Danny was excellent in his service as usual. My partner and I have been regular customers and the food has been always cooked with absolute perfection. Really enjoy coming to Nandos Broad Street! I had a brilliant experience at Nando’s thanks to Badger, our waiter. From the moment we arrived, he greeted us warmly and made us feel welcome straight away. Throughout our meal, he checked in at the right times without being intrusive and ensured everything was perfect. He was friendly, attentive, and genuinely seemed to care about his customers. It’s rare to come across such great customer service these days, and Badger really stood out. He made our visit even more enjoyable – Nando’s are lucky to have him on their team!

We came there at around 330pm. They were quite busy as we had to wait awhile for the food. We waited a bit for the starters to come but the intervals between starters and mains is ok as the wait for the mains was not that long. Food is great though and worth the wait. Staff are friendly and helpful. Decors in the restaurant we’re nice. Provided that the restaurant is busy it was still clean and tidy. It took a whole for the ice maker to generate some ice though. I guess as the weather got a bit more warmer in the afternoon everyone wanted ice. Just the soft drink felt a bit flat so this might need looking at. Otherwise we had a good experience and enjoyed the food. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 I love Nando’s but for some reason this franchise is not the best. The staff are really nice and attentive but for some reason, I never get my meal. Table of four every time and I end up not receiving my order or on this occasion, I got it the last one while everyone was finishing up. Don’t know if it’s a curse or something lol but will definitely go back as it’s 5 mins away and I love the food. Bought the frozen yogurt but the machine didn’t work.. I guess McDonald’s jinxed them 🥲😂. Everything else was really nice. Place was clean. Both staff who helped us were very helpful, a brunet and the welcoming staff who was blonde. I wish I was good with names. I was wishing to try the Mac and cheese and the veggie patty but both out of stock 🤷🏻‍♀️ maybe next time Amazing food and service. It was my girlfriend's first Nandos experience and she definitely wasn't disappointed. We'll come here again and very soon! Highly recommended ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Loved it here. Went on Wednesday and Friday and on both days I had a wonderful experience. Great food and service. Lauren and Dani went above and beyond. Overall fantastic experience. I will definitely come back in the future. I can count on one hand how many bad nandos I have had...unfortunately both of them were here, on the same night.
We waited 35 minutes for our mains, seeing tables seated before us getting served. When our food eventually turned up, all the chicken was cold, and the sides weren't any better.
When we raised this a supervisor/manager came over and took it away to get new dishes.
Unfortunately, when the replacements turned up, the chicken was barely warm again, but by this point, having already driven half the country, we weren't up for more waiting.
If it wasn't for the helpfulness and nature of the woman who dealt with us, I'd be giving this a 1 star.",0.8,0.2,"[""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['nandos', 'mains', 'ice', 'experience definitely', 'guess', 'starters', 'turned', 'wait', 'reason', 'weren']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""nandos"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""reason"", ""guess"", ""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""mains"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""experience definitely"", ""Waiting Time"", ""weren"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""wait"", ""ice"", ""turned"", ""starters"", ""Burger"", ""Experience""]"

The service felt fast with multiple options and extras; e.g. guacamole for £1.30, but the servers were fine and didn't hassle us when we asked questions or declined paying any extra.

The beans looked like they had been sat for a long time, tide mark around the container, but tasted fine.  I had a burrito and the main content is rice, with a small scoop of your chosen main. Cheese and various salsas as well as beans were included. No additional salad, so pretty traditional. You could pay extra for sour cream and guacamole.  A small tub, slightly larger than a McDonald's self serve sauce pot was the size. The guacamole tasted good with no brown bits to it and we saw the team making it fresh.

Tables were small with small chairs which had low backs for some reason. Bench and banqueting seating was also available.

Wooden forks were available. I also think metal knives were available, but they looked dirty so I did not bother with those.

The three tacos were very small, so ideal for a light snack. Add fries or other extras if you are after more of a lunch. Went there today and had a medium burrito eat in, and let's just say the portion was not even half of the one in Oxford. The bowle was practically empty!!!! Feeling absolutely robbed and scammed out of my money after this visit, will be the last time i do as standards are not what they used to be which is a shame. Prices have increased which is understandable but to reduce the food customers get by a significant amount is not justifiable. I used to always order a large chicken quesadilla which used to come with a bag of tortilla chips, salsa dip and sour cream on the side. However, the quesadilla now is not a quesadilla, it used to be made and cut into 4 slices but now they make it like a burrito and slice it in half. I was about to walk away whilst the staff were making it as i was appalled at the little filling they were putting into it. It now also just comes with the pot of salsa dip, no sour cream or tortilla chips, you have to pay extra for that. I used to be absolutely full from how the quesadilla that used to be made but this time i was left feeling hungry and disappointed, there were parts of the wrap that didn't have any filling in it whatsoever. Not worth the price paid and won't be returning. The food here is great. I had the Christmas quesadilla which was really tasty with a mild dipping sauce.
The service was friendly and fast.
Only issue is the seating area is poorly maintained. The table I sat at had a broken chilli bottle that poured all over the table.
Given that it was now dry and sticky it was pretty obvious nobody has come past to clean it in at least a few hours.

The cafe was busy when we walked in, but they did manage to find a table for the two of us. The interior has the current trend of unfinished ceilings, where the air conditioning and electrical ductwork are exposed. We had a friendly & helpful waitress who engaged with us. The meals were lovely and tasty. My only criticism is that my meal wasn't that hot, but it didn't spoil the experience Came for brunch on a Sunday. As a walk-in, our group of 3 only had to wait 10 minutes for a table.

This place has a nice atmosphere and we weren’t rushed at all throughout our meal or after.

The menu is interesting with interesting spins on some breakfast foods. There was some flexibility with some of the dishes, for example picking the type of egg for the house breakfast.

Recommend this place for brunch, especially if you are looking for a place centrally located, near New Street station. Due to being a frequent travel through Birmingham, i have always been wanting to see what Yorks Cafe was offering (I only wanted something to drink since i had a huge breakfast).

I was greeted with a wonderful server who asked if i had any special requests or allergies, before coming around to take my order. The atmosphere was a nice vintage look inside. Personally I do love that style of environment.

Moving on, they have a large variety of food and drinks and i tried one of their special lattes which had turmeric, cinnamon and ginger. The taste was unique and i had nothing like it before. It definitely refreshed my pallet.

Overall, i am very pleased with the coffee and the staff and will definitely have to revisit within the near future. Thank you so much for your service. Lovely spot for a hot drink or a quick bite.

We visited on Saturday morning for a light breakfast. Their sourdough with a choice of spreads was tasty - we each got to try a combo of spreads with our sourdough (peanut butter & Jam and peanut butter and honey.

Items and reasonably priced.

We were lucky to get a table quickly and staff were friendly and attentive.

It does get very busy here as it is a small establishment. I was in Birmingham for a City break with a friend and we discover York’s on google when we arrived at the Train station. Last Sunday we were starving after our journey coming from London so we decided to have a brunch.
The cafe was very busy but we didn’t have to wait long to get a table, we ordered a Yorks House Breakfast which was so delicious, Fried chicken & French Toast with a beautiful sauce on the side and the Masala fries which were very tasty. Staff was really lovely and friendly.
Also great coffee selection and perfect atmosphere for a Café.
We went back again for more coffee and Avocado smashed and Feta cheeses on Toast, so yummy!

Great selection of drinks, all prepared very well. Very friendly staff, great vibe! Food was very tasty but on a small side for the price. My tofu muffin had quality ingredients cooked well, but I imagine very small for a standard customer. This, chips and a nice matcha drink was enough for me though and I would most likely go there again when being in Birmingham again to try other options to check if they are better value for money. We arrived at 9.05 as I booked the table for 9, we then got told it only opened at 9.30. I said my booking was for 9, the reception wasn't the best. I had to ask her if we could wait inside because my mum is unable to walk, let alone stand for long. We got attended at 9.37, the food was ok, the coffee was very good. It's not a place I would come back to. lovely little location, with great variety of brunch and sandwiches - I had the paradox of choice. I'm going back to try the rest of the menu. Quality gone down a lot👎🏻I used to loved yorks and buy their beans. However, visited this branch twice this week. I had a soya latte which you can see the latte art on top is awful and didn’t foam well(I wouldn’t serve this tbh if I made this.) The second time I had a oat cappuccino as you can see the cup is not full and just look like
coffee from a vending machine and taste blanch and sour. It’s not worth £4.50 at all. I can see some other reviews saying the quality has gone down as well. There is much better place and independent shop to support so no more yorks. I expected more from Yorks as I am a fan of the branch. However, the coffee portions are much smaller than any other cafe i’ve been to! Barely enough for a caffeine kick! A pathetic portion of tea as well. Very overpriced for what you get. There’s nothing groundbreaking about the coffee flavour or techniques. I’m disappointed with the cost not matching the quality.

The service was good and the location and seating is nice, there is a brunch menu available. Honestly i won’t be coming to Yorks for coffee again as it’s money down the drain.

Robert took the time to explain everything clearly, which really helped me understand what was going on and made me feel at ease throughout the process. I highly recommend him to anyone dealing with back issues or looking for a skilled and knowledgeable practitioner. Fantastic experience from start to finish! This doctor is amazing.

Very easy to get an appointment. Upon arrival, free parking if available on the drive.

Dr Robert is brilliant doctor (if you allowed to call him that). He asked a series of questions and does a small diagnosis physically on you. He is straight away able to identify the problem.

Although he booked me for 1 hour; we surpassed our time and he completed his session. He gave clear instructions on what he's doing to me and assured me every step.

I was very happy that he broke the technical terms and explained whilst working on my body.

Feel so much better after visiting him. His prices are very good and reasonable in comparison to other places. Will definitely come back if I require his services again. I had been suffering with back pain for weeks. Spent an hour with Rob. Felt the difference immediately. Amazing. Robert is both professional and friendly. He made my first visit very relaxing despite me being nervous, not knowing what to expect and I would highly recommend him to you as well.
I've been visiting Robert probably for the last 8 years now. I did my research on local chiropractors at the time and Robert's practice was the most suitable.
His very knowledgeable about his work and regularly shares best posture techniques to resolve any issues I have. He managed to pin point my back issues with extreme accuracy and cure my suffering.
I have recommend Robert many times to family members and friends, who have never been disappointed with my recommendation. I've been visiting Rob at Chiro relief for maybe 10 (?) years now for regular maintenance on a dodgy back, after recommendation from a friend. Have recommended him to others who have also liked working with him.

Food was delicious and portion sizes were really good. Fresh and full of flavours, really enjoyed our meal there this evening. It's wonderful to see this restaurant is still going strong. The decor is traditional, the staff are lovely & the food is delicious.
We had the prawn & scallop starters & we both decided on the crab linguine. The portions are far more generous than other restaurants in the centre of Birmingham & it's great value for money. I had a brilliant evening at La Galleria. The service was warm and friendly from the moment I walked in, and the whole place had a really cosy, authentic Italian feel.

I started with the meatballs, and they were absolutely delicious – tender, full of flavour, and served in a rich, tasty sauce. For my main, I had a pizza, and it was spot on. Perfectly thin and crispy base, generous toppings, and that proper wood-fired taste you only get at a good Italian place.

The atmosphere was relaxed but lively, and I could tell a lot of people there were regulars – always a good sign. I left feeling full, happy, and already planning my next visit.

Highly recommend if you’re in Birmingham and fancy proper Italian food done right. One of a ""HIDDEN GEM"" in birmingham.
I feel like I went to 90's europe movie.
The food was really good , the portion was big. Everyone is so friendly here. I would love to come again to enjoy a pizza at the outside sitting area. The food is delicious, and that cannot be denied. The prices are very very reasonable for what you get. The portions are quite large. However, the only thing stopping me and my family from coming here is the service. The waiter seemed very passive aggressive and he kept trying to pressure us into many things, even though we clearly didn't want to get some stuff. He also was quite hard to understand.

As there was a social meet up via the Meetup app. But other than that I would not come here that freely, as explained below

The staff at 200 Degrees Coffee were friendly and helpful. As well as the service was good.

Other important notes, this place does not accept cash/coin payments, only via card. So if you’re a O.G who would like to pay by cash/coins, I would not recommend this cafe to you. Also to note this place is not a dog free place (unfortunately). So if you were to value hygiene above all else this place is not for you.

So as a person who is a sceptic of dog culture in general I would not see myself coming back to this coffee shop.

To the dog nutters who maybe reading this review, if you like potential dog faeces/dog urine across the floor of this cafe, bumping into dogs or getting too close to dogs (near to immoral purposes?) this place is for you! Been twice now to this location and found it to be my new favourite place in Birmingham. Really nicely decorated, clean (as a carer for someone with a low immune system im quite tough to please on this subject.) the vegan selection is lovely and the cinnamon bun was stunning. My first visit I went with a friend for tea and a catch up, my second visit I sat and read my book over a pot of tea. Being able to order to the table is brilliant as I could get settled and not worry about leaving my things to order. Toilets upstairs and downstairs, accessible and clean. Staff are friendly. A real gem of Birmingham. Nice coffee shop in Colmor Row. Staff were friendly & helpful.  We ordered our 2 coffees  & then given an order number for the table. The interior is a combination of open brick work, soft lighting, and wooden accents, which sets itself apart from other coffee shops.  We waited for a couple of minutes & our coffees we're brought to the table. Nice informal atmosphere where you can meet up with friends or do some work quietly on a laptop. I come here every morning before work without fail. The team are incredible and always remember my order and know where I love to sit. They’re so accommodating!
Absolutely love it here, I’m able to bring meetings here and it’s super convenient. Massive thank you to Ram, Luke and the rest of the gang! I’ve been a loyal customer at this cafe for a year and I always come with my family. I even have a membership and visit often because I really liked this place. But sadly, I had another disappointing experience.

This is the second time this has happened. I came with my whole family and my little brother, who is 5 years old, had his own food because he can’t eat anything else. He was the only one with food from outside the rest of the family were going to order from the cafe as usual.

Unfortunately, the staff didn’t allow us to stay because of my little brother’s food. They were not helpful at all and didn’t even try to understand the situation.

I felt really unwelcome and disappointed because I’ve supported this cafe for a whole year and always recommended it to others. But after this, I won’t come back again.

The stairs up to the restaurant don't do the place justice, inside is eclectic but I guess most people will like it.

The staff are very friendly, a bit quick off the mark for us but they are patient and helpful. Typical Bangladeshi menu, perhaps a bit light on specials but there is something there for everyone. The waiter was pushing one dish but by now I know what I like. The drinks choice is pretty good, pinot grigio by the glass and Bombay Bycicle in bottles as well as a very nice Cobra on draught.
The chutney trays accompanying the poppadoms were the best I have had, ever.
The sheekh kebab was quite hot and flavoursome but I prefer a finer minced lamb. The salad was excellent and it came fried onions which is not always the case in Harborne.
The mains and sides were perfect for us, couldn't fault anything. None of that tri-colour food colouring in pilau rice either.
Portion are very generous and we ordered too much, however we now have two takeaways in the freezer.

The selection of things to paint is also great really high quality prices and very on trend.

100% worth a visit! I had such a lovely experience at Glaze Room in Birmingham! The place is warm, welcoming, and beautifully set up for a relaxing and creative time. The staff were super friendly and helpful throughout the visit, and everything was really well-organized. It’s a perfect spot for a fun day out with friends or a unique activity to try. I’ll definitely be back highly recommended 🫶🏻 Had a fantastic time! The atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming, and we really enjoyed the whole experience. Big shoutout to Nandini — she was incredibly patient, friendly, and made the session so much fun. Highly recommend if you're looking for something creative and calming to do! Me and my friend went here, lovely place. They offer a snack and a cold drink with your time slot and unlimited hot drinks! The staff are nice and friendly and they teach you the best ways to paint on your chosen item. The wait to pick up the item isn’t too long either! Brilliant couple of hours spent with friends decorating a variety of pottery items. The space is busy but well laid out, the staff are lovely and helpful with advice and information (but get out of the way quickly to allow you to create!).

Booked this afternoon for the first time and well impressed.
Plenty of roadside parking as well as a car park to the side.
The restaurant is comfortable and well planned.
The staff we encountered were superb - attentive and friendly - a real asset to the place.
However - the roast beef Sunday lunch was next level - a healthy portion, cooked to perfection AND halfway through the offer of additional Yorkshire puds and roasties - just next level.
Just a wonderful place for a Sunday lunch.
We’ll be back, again and again wife's aunt.  I have been a few times before but not for a couple of years. However, it was superb, certainly the best Sunday lunch I have had for many years. Service wonderful and wine excellent. If you're looking for somewhere different with outstanding food and nice surroundings try here. After I wrote the above review, two weeks later I took my wife. Not as good. I had soup but sent it back because it was luke warm. Again, I had beef, served pink but it was tough and everything else was just tepid. My wife chose roast pork which was fatty. A real disappointment. I struggle to see why restaurants can't deliver consistency with their food. Came here for my birthday. We had gone elsewhere originally, but foolishly didn’t check the menu online, and it wasn’t really to our liking.

So we ended up taking a short walk here.

We haven’t been for a few months, as a guy here (possibly the manager) has been rude and snappy with us a few times. Tonight was anything but that. It was a great experience and really restored my confidence in this place.

The bad (if I have to say it)
Two staff. And one of them - Will, I think? - pulled from the bar. Absolutely wonderful lads, who managed to look after the entire main area of the restaurant, but clearly needed help. It would have been a lot more efficient with just one more person. But they did their best. They were warm and welcoming, offering wonderful advice, remembering it was my birthday, and just having fun with us. This counts for SO much, and it’s a big reminder of how awesome this place can be.

The good? Again, the two guys on waiter duty. Much respect for managing to look after the place. You were excellent.
The gent who made me a whisky sour. My favourite cocktail, and I just haven’t managed to get one in Birmingham since I came back from abroad. And he made it to perfection. Even including the egg white. What. A. Legend.
The chicken wings. I know, I know. They’re chicken wings. But that glaze…

Honestly, the food is always good here. My burger was decent, but I wish I had had my wife’s summer aubergine salad. That was absolutely amazing.

Excellent wine choices. I appreciate they are triple retail price, but they’ve clearly gone through work to source, as Highfield has never let me down with a good wine. So I’m happy to pay.
And one of the best things? We didn’t even have to pay much as they gave me £25 off with it being my birthday…

Food, ambience, cleanliness, decor - all great.

But it’s the people that will keep me coming back. And the staff on tonight… Will and the other gent. And the legendary bartender (Steve? Apologies if I have that wrong).

Just a really good birthday meal, folks. Not too pricey, and the most fun my wife and I have had out in ages.

Thank you, guys! Delicious food with beautiful plating and a really nice atmosphere. The steak was cooked perfectly and everything we ordered was full of flavour. While the staff seemed to be in a rush, making the service feel a bit hectic, the bartender was friendly and chatty, which made up for it. Overall, a great spot for a quality meal in a stylish setting. I came over from Ireland to celebrate my birthday with family. Kids booked lunch   And I was greeted by beautiful girl  with a happy birthday. We were all in shock and we ordered an amazing meal  with dessert. Out came  dessert with happy birthday. We still in shock as my kids said nothing about my birthday.  When leaving my son asked how did you know it was my mom’s birthday, they saw me quickly open one of my cards with mom on it . We were blown away . Just the little things they picked up on . The staff were absolutely amazing such a beautiful energy and definitely will be back again .

I wanted whipped cream on my drink, which took the worker not even 5 seconds to change on the register. She proceeded to give me dirty looks and huff and puff. I told her it was my first time ordering from that cafe and she was still incredibly rude and giving me attitude. It felt so embarassing to be berated by the lady, when she was so welcoming to other customers. Popped in on a very hot University open day. Staff were friendly, kind and efficient. Must make particular mention of Smita- lovely smile even at the end of what must have been a very long and busy day for them. Thank you for the ice! Walked a mile only to find it closed... maybe review your online opening times... it is not open Saturdays Quick, friendly service.  Food and drink are good value.  Clean and bright, good location (in Library) It gets very busy in the evening.  Will go again. The worst university café this is.

The staff is dishonest and rude.

I should've read the reviews before coming but I didn't, as many others agree that the staff is rude.

I came to buy a £4 meal deal, which fits my budget as a student. The meal deal includes a sandwich, a drink, and a snack. However, the particular sandwich I picked up wasn't included in the meal deal, so I ended up paying £7.90, it's my fault really, but the staff was annoyed when I asked.

I was gonna buy a cup of tea but I've already used up my lunch budget, so I asked the staff politely if she could fill my cup with some hot water please, she told me that their hot water machine is broken too, same as the one in library lounge. Yes the one in library lounge is broken, that's why I asked if I could get some hot water from the café, after paying for a meal as a customer. But the machine in the café isn't broken. All other customers behind me all managed to get tea that's filled with hot water.

Is it that hard to be a nice, decent and considering human once for a while?

The Bull Ring Market is my go-to spot for affordable and authentic African products. You’ll find everything from fresh food items to traditional fabrics, spices, and household essentials all at very reasonable prices. The market is lively, with friendly vendors and a welcoming atmosphere.

If you're looking to shop quality on a budget, this is definitely the place. Highly recommended! A Fantastic Day Out at the Bullring Fish & Meat Market

I always enjoy my trips to the Bullring Market – especially the fish and meat section, which is all under one clean, well-kept building. There’s a brilliant variety of fresh fish, meats, and even vegetables – something for every taste. My wife and I love going together to pick out the best cuts and freshest catch of the day. It’s more than just shopping – it’s a fun day out for the whole family. The friendly atmosphere, great prices, and top-quality produce make it one of Birmingham’s true hidden gems. Highly recommended – check out my photos to see why!
Follow more of my reviews and activities on Instagram: @h_bermani Bought some crabs at the newly opened seafood stall near to the centre of the entrance from China town.  It wasn't cheap.  When I was washing the crabs it got horrible smell.  I was sure they weren't fresh.  Still tried to cook it as normal and nicely. Unfortunately, it tasted amonia and the bad smell still there after cooking.  Had to bin it straight away.  This shop has no conscience to provide such poisonous seafood! Decent food for really low prices. Although you do have to make sure to check all the food you're buying, because sometimes it has fungus. The stalls only sell food that is in season. Way cheaper than a grocery store so I recommend buying food essentials there (e.g. vegetables, fruits, etc). You get foods that you wouldn't usually find in a grocery store, so if you want to try something new, this would be a good opportunity.
The market is really dirty, I don't think they clean it very often. I go there almost every week, and there is usually a drunkard or another kind of weirdo, but if you stay out of their way, then they ignore you. You can get high quality stuff second hand and new done stuff you find is marks and Spencers quality like underwear and such you can find herbs and spices .watch fixing at a good price scented candles and incense, clothing for work such as high vis.these are just some of the business I have frequented (replica perfumes)",0.6,0.4,"[""Seafood"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['market', 'grocery', 'crabs', 'essentials', 'fish', 'african', 'seafood', 'spices', 'buying', 'vegetables']","[""Recommendation Tendency"", ""market"", ""Service"", ""grocery"", ""spices"", ""african"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""essentials"", ""vegetables"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""buying"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Seafood"", ""seafood"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Value"", ""crabs"", ""Experience"", ""fish""]"

So I basically ate 1 hashbrown, 2 sausage, 3 half toast, beans but not all and 1 egg for £13!

The music was the best experience Food standard has deteriorated massively . Eggs were hard and rigid , hash brown lacking the usual flavour and worse of all sausages were rock hard that even using a knife was a struggle. Not sure what happened to the standard of this place ?
Used to frequent it weekly . Came back after almost 2 months and was aghast at how poor the food now has become Breakfast was awful,sausage tasted like pure fat,bacon was hard and cold,mushrooms like they had been found the on the floor all with ten baked beans!

I paid roughly £4.70 which I thought was good value.

The cafe is situated within a university campus (I think), so the typical clientel I assume are students and lecturers. It is tucked away from busy areas in Birmingham so I don't think the general public tend to visit this cafe, although it is open to all.

I took a star off because the tandoori chicken itself was of poor quality; it came in small cubes which did not look like chicken at all, and I didn't really taste the tandoori flavour.

It appeared the cafe only served halal meat in their products (I have no issues with it, but worth noting for new customers reading this review).

I would definitely go again, but I wouldn't order another chicken product. Great Chai, nice calm place with a good range of lunch items.

Nice and clean, good variation of different types of wall, snacks at reasonable prices Would definitely recommend! What a fantastic experience! We visited as a family and all thoroughly enjoyed the climbing. There was a great variety of walls to suit different abilities, which kept it exciting for everyone. The staff were friendly, professional, and made us feel welcome throughout. Thank you for such a wonderful day! I’ve been taking my 6-year-old daughter Olivia to Rock Up Birmingham for two weeks in a row, and I couldn’t be happier with the experience. A special shout-out to Chantal, who has been absolutely amazing with my child. Her encouragement, guidance, and gentle support gave Olivia such a strong sense of safety and confidence.

Today, for the first time, Olivia reached the very top of the wall — she was over the moon! It was a proud and joyful moment, and I could truly see a love for climbing beginning to grow in her. I’m so grateful for Chantal and the Rock Up team. You’ve planted a climbing seed in my child’s heart, and we’ll be back every week to nurture it.

Good services, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, and more. Also great cold drinks, lemonade, pepsi original, and max, oj, sparkling water. There are also some cookies, which tasted nice. A great lounge to visit before the train ride! Very quiet little lounge just off platform 3/4. It's quiet small with lots of comfy seats, most of them next to plugs for all your charging needs. There's a toilet there which is handy - it's a single cubicle suitable for disabled and as a bonus is clean (phew!).

As for snacks - it's not exactly snacks galore but there are those amazing uglies chocs, biscuits in a packet, soft drinks (pepsi, lemonade, tomato juice and water) and a coffee machine. There's also a selection teas (mint/green/earl grey/eng breakfast/etc.).

I mean it could be slightly better if I am honest but if you have the right ticket you can avoid the temptations of spending more money in the station or getting on with work.

Location is a bit of a pain if you are due to travel from platforms 6 upward as you have to go out of the ticket barrier and in through another one. I guess it wasn't worth their while making 2 lounges  although I was kinda expecting some secret tunnel gimmick (ok let's face that WOULD have been worth it!!) to the other side. Small, clean and generally ok. It would be better to have a few more screens for train updates. Located in the BLUE ZONE.

The staff are friendly and knowledgeable.
They also offers delicious pastries and light snacks that pair perfectly with their beverages. I approve 👍🏾 This place doesn’t just serve coffee, it slaps your taste buds awake, gives them a TED Talk, and then hugs them with oat milk. Walked in needing a caffeine fix, walked out convinced I could launch a startup, run a marathon, and write a novel ...all at once.

If you're in Brum and not sipping something from Java Roastery, you’re just paying rent in the wrong part of town. Came on a Sunday morning and found this to be a chilled place to hang out for a while.

Good coffee. Comfortable seating. Music is suitably quiet. A handful of solo people on laptops. No stress. Definitely better than the big chain coffee place opposite!

Very nice place to eat and have a few drinks. I've had the vegetable lasagne with chips which comes out as a large portion size. My friends have had fish and chips which again is very tasty.   This place is often busy during lunch and after work around 5 - 7. However the atmosphere and staff are very friendly. You can open up a bar tab if required. It is spacious inside and they can open up the new 'Barwick Room' if required. It can also be booked for party and events. Came for a retirement celebration. It was very full and difficult to get a drink. As the bar is longhand narrow due to the two rooms it became very full very quickly and almost uncomfortable.  The food would have been better being put out on a table rather than being taken round on platters, as some of it was difficult to eat without a plate. All the food was delicious, staff were accomodating if not a little overwhlemed at times. Maybe too small to have a function room as half of the bar itself?",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Seafood"", ""Ethiopian""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Special Occasion""]","['bar', 'required', 'difficult', 'start finish', 'plate', 'wife', 'chef', 'prepared', 'finish', 'birthday']","[""birthday"", ""plate"", ""Ethiopian"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""wife"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""bar"", ""chef"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""required"", ""Portion Size"", ""prepared"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Drinks"", ""difficult"", ""Seafood"", ""Fast Food"", ""finish"", ""Special Occasion"", ""start finish"", ""Experience""]"

While the focus is primarily on drinks—of which there is a great selection—it's worth noting that there isn't any food served. However, the option to bring your own food is a fantastic touch, allowing for a more personalized experience.

The atmosphere is inviting, with a nice ambience that makes it a great spot to unwind. I loved the variety of games available, including Ludo, Uno, and Dominique’s, which added an extra layer of fun to the evening.

The staff were exceptionally friendly, making us feel welcomed and well taken care of. A special shout-out to Liby, who was particularly nice and attentive, enhancing our overall experience.

Overall, Queen’s Bar is a great place to enjoy drinks with friends, play some games, and bring your own snacks. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a relaxed and enjoyable night out! Stunning glazed tiles on the outside of the pub (traditional for Birmingham pubs in the victorian era) gives the Queens Arms a great look. The interior is good, an ideal place for socialising. There is a small outdoor area at the rear of the pub. Had a pint of Guinness which was exceptional. Nice pub with a cosy little beer terrace and upstairs seating. Very clean pub and friendly service behind the bar. Sadly lacking in choice for any local beers, very disappointing considering the plentiful options of breweries across the street. Nonetheless a no frills pub that's good for one lunch time pint to pass the time. Queen Arms Newhall St B31SW: My Experience is as follows.

Queens Arms is on Newhall St situated on the corner and opposite 141 Newhall St a few yards away from the BT Tower in City Center of Birmingham .

Stepping inside one is Greeted by Highly Professionally Trained - very polite and friendly Bar Staff. On the Bar Stand - real ale is Served.  There are 5 tall traditional - Stylishly Outstanding Majestic -  row of Sliver Beer Dispensing Pumps Making it A Central focal point. ( See Photos ) 5 Stars

It’s a very clean pub  with Combination of bottle green and wood seating area;  Big Gold Mirrors and a fire place  go hand in hand for decoration. It’s a lovely & a Beautiful  very tranquil  place.

Queen‘S Arms is painted in traditional Brick-red / Burgundy & Cream colours. Also there Is a seating area outside comprised of Big Original Oak Beer Barrels with Bar Stools which is ideal for enjoying Food & Drinks on a Sunny day in the Fresh air and see the traffic / people go by.

Food is on the Menu certain days of the Week ( see Menu) and variety’s of Board Games on  a stand anyone can access.

Food was stunning to the eye and in taste.

However I feel like the cabbage was unwashed.
(I don’t know if cabbage is supposed to be washed or not, but it shouldn’t have a black spot that may be a bug on it) Absolutely fantastic,  fresh tasty food , we went here for my sons 16th birthday and they made it amazing from start to finish , our waitress Grace was so attentive she was amazing a real credit to her team Really enjoyed the aged beef steak here, it was yummy.
The set meal to me was more worth it, we could select more.
Meats were cooked well, seafood was also done well, desserts were a little too overly sweet.
Environment is nice and comfy, lighting is abit too dark, people are quite rowdy, but overall it’s nice. Miller & Carter Mailbox is a fantastic spot for steak and cocktails if you’re in Birmingham. From the moment I arrived, the team was warm and welcoming, making the entire experience comfortable and enjoyable. I didn’t have to wait long for my food everything was served promptly and with great attention to detail.

I ordered the medium ribeye steak, and it was cooked to absolute perfection, juicy, flavourful, and tender. I also had a cocktail called Strawberry Fields, with a touch of elderflower, and it was truly mind-blowing, refreshing and beautifully balanced.

The table and surroundings were spotless, and the quality of the meat was very impressive. I would also like to give a special mention to Renee, who looked after my table with exceptional care and professionalism. Additionally, I had the pleasure of meeting Kiran, Ayush, and Atharva, members of the kitchen team, who were incredibly welcoming and clearly dedicated to delivering food to the highest standard.

Thank you to the entire team for making my visit so enjoyable. I’ll definitely be back to try more dishes! Good service. Nadine was fab! I recommend the white chocolate creme brulee. It's delicious.

Just not worth the money. The service is mediocre and not too friendly Good coffee and amazing customer service found here! I sat in the seated area and witnessed some of the best cafe customer service ever. Many people were served very quickly and without any fuss or frustration on display. Groups of paramedics, patients, hospital staff and visitors were all involved in some form of conversation during order taking and whilst making collections.  I was really surprised for some reason. It was good to see.

One member of staff went above and beyond helping me with a phone issue I had and considering the circumstances of why I am at the QE today waiting she has no idea how much I value that gesture of kindness.

I feel that the management of this cafe should recognise and reward all the team members working today as they really are doing a great job and are a credit to Costa Coffee. They did not run out of friendliness, enthusiasm and energy in all the time I was here over 2 hours during peak times on a Saturday.

Thank you. Very rude and unhelpful staff. There appeared to be an issue with the app. It appeared that they wanted to blame you and charge you extra. There was no apology for the inconvenience just extreme rudeness. You need to look at how your staff communicate and treat customers especially when it is in a hospital.

It looks very futuristic inside and being a luxe offers that extra level of comfort whilst watching your film. The screen s are huge and the sound quality is great too. The staff are very friendly and polite and the toilets are very clean indeed. Certainly worth a visit if you are in the area and want to watch a movie. There is also 3 hours of free parking which is a big car park underneath the cinema itself. Just make sure you validate your car registration when you are in the cinema. Highly recommended The cinema is really great overall – the atmosphere is fantastic, and the movie selection is always on point. However, the prices for food and drinks are quite high, which can be a bit off-putting. Also, in some of the theaters, the seats aren’t the most comfortable, which can affect your experience. That said, it’s still an excellent place to catch a movie, especially if you get the membership for £20 a month. It makes the whole experience much more affordable and enjoyable! The movie itself was great and I really enjoyed it. However, the wait for snacks was far too long – I queued for about 30 minutes just to get popcorn, a Tango Ice Blast, and nachos. The service seemed disorganised, and unfortunately I ended up missing the start of the film because of it. I’d recommend they improve staffing or efficiency at the concessions so customers don’t have this issue. ODEON Luxe Birmingham Broadway Plaza is a top-tier cinema that takes your movie-going experience to the next level. The moment you step in, it feels like a treat—modern design, clean spaces, and an inviting atmosphere. The real magic happens inside the screens, though. Every seat is a luxurious recliner with plenty of legroom, so you can fully relax while watching. The sound and visuals are incredible—crisp and immersive, perfect for films like Moana 2. It's a great place for families, couples, or even solo movie nights. Plus, their snacks and drinks selection is solid, from classic popcorn to more premium options. If you want comfort and quality for your cinema trips, this is the spot. The cinema is great, the screens and the seats are probably the best in Birmingham. However, the snack and food service is horrible. The team struggle with orders, people are waiting over half an hour for their food and snacks. It’s a shame for such a great cinema, they definitely need to change the way they prepare food and the order system. Visited again today and the whole service was crazy, people were kicking off with the staff, swearing and getting aggressive, the staff didn’t seem to care. Orders were getting mixed up and the staff seemed to crumble under pressure. I would probably recommend how cinema orders used to be here, singular queue with multiple tills open and doing an order at a time instead of trying to do multiple orders in one go and getting confused what order they were on which was happening today.

Took a couple of bites, realised there was no bacon. Instead of replacing my burger, it was left on the pass for another five minutes whilst they cooked bacon and put in on the plate and brought over to me.

Fries were cold and hard. One of the worst meals I've had for a long time. Staff were pleasant but don't know how to deal with their own errors. Had a beef burger today and was rather disappointed - bun was tiny and the patty was barely thicker than a sheet of bacon. Taste wasn't overly great either; may as well just go to maccies. Awful food. Burger meat was tasteless and dry. The fries had the texture of fries that had been cooked hours before and kept hot for a while. They had gone dry and chewy. I was incredibly disappointed by the service I received at GBK (Selly Oak).  I ordered a vegan burger and a bacon cheese (beef) burger with Uber Eats from GBK.  When my food arrived (stone cold), neither of the burgers were labelled.  They looked identical, meaning that, without the labels, it was impossible to identify which burger was vegan and which contained meat.  Neither of the burgers contained bacon, meaning that we could not even use the bacon to identify which burger was the meat burger - and increased the possibility that our order was just wrong and that both burgers were beef burgers!

When we contacted GBK, they were really rude and offered no help whatsoever; we were not offered a replacement or a refund.  Uber Eats only gave us a 79p refund on a £22 order to cover the delivery charge rather than the mix up with the food.  This meant that we were unable to eat our meal and ended up £22 out of pocket and having to buy food from elsewhere.

Unbelievably disappointed.  If you have dietary requirements especially, I would strongly suggest not eating/ordering from here. Never again. Went today and waited 25mins, even though they were quite. Kids burger was black and burnt and I honestly think the staff knew it. A refund for the kids burger was provided, but I won't be returning and the staff don't really care and its very expensive for the quality.",0.0,1.0,"[""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Value"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['burger', 'bacon', 'gbk', 'burgers', 'fries', 'beef burger', 'identify', 'burger meat', 'refund', 'contained']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""fries"", ""burgers"", ""Service"", ""identify"", ""Food Quality"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Waiting Time"", ""bacon"", ""refund"", ""beef burger"", ""gbk"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Fast Food"", ""burger meat"", ""contained"", ""Value"", ""burger"", ""Burger"", ""Experience""]"

Absolutely love the pizza cones! Never seen them anywhere else in UK but loved it. Visited Cone Hub with family and everybody enjoyed their meals. All made fresh on the spot.

Cannot wait to visit again and online orders are accepted too which is brilliant.
Plenty of seating inside and got parking on nearby side roads so didn't have to walk far at all. The concept of a pizza in a cone is unique and new.

WOW the food is absolutely delicious. Fantastic value for money and very good portion sizes.
Delivery was very quick, everything was absolutely perfect.. We will be regulars here now, best place for miles better than any other dessert shop. Packaging is great too.

The decoration of the cafe is cute. The tables were clean and well maintained.

What let it down was the food. Very basic and very little of the menu is actually Disney themed. The Caesar salad was not great - you had to pay extra if you wanted chicken in it. I didn’t want the chicken but my mum did - and it was basically 2 chicken nuggets? Instead of diced chicken (without breadcrumbs), as you would normally get in a Caesar salad. Very strange. The salad had far too much vinaigrette dressing so tasted sour. The Mickey waffle was okay; Disney themed at least.

As 2 adults we were disappointed, so I can’t even imagine how disappointing it would be for children who are excited to go somewhere Disney themed and are met with this. Again, our server was lovely but the rest was disappointing and I probably wouldn’t return. PRIMARK one of there largest stores is right in the center. 2nd floor you can find the Disney cafe. Very relaxing with great tasting coffee. Cakes are available that all looked amazing. Whilst sitting here it seemed to be a firm favourite for the children that are shopping with there parents. Service is excellent but please note that its cashless. So debit, credit card only. Disney element - barely. Minimal theming.
Food. Cafe food with mickey shaped items. Ordered 2 mickey waffles and was told the machine was broken and we have to have round ones. We continued to order and was still waiting after 30 mins.
Service. Not great. 1 bloke trying to do everything but not managing to achieve anything. He got distracted from every job. 3 women who had 1 task and didn't do any of it well or efficiently. Not even attempting basic customer service
Cleanliness. Poor. Filthy tables and floors and no one paying attention in the lunch time rush to clean up tables and keep customers coming in.

Might have the disney brand but it's a basic cafe in A primark. The Simpson one appeared to be better run. Utterly disappointed with our visit to the disney cafe , minimal disney theming , dirty tables menus just left on the floor.  Only went for a cup of tea which I thought would of at least come in a disney themed cup instead was given a white polyesteren cup  with lukewarm tea. The tray it came on  was disgusting and was told to leave at 4pm as they was closing . Definitely not worth the visit , it completely ruined the disney magic Not as expensive as you'd think and really delicious!!! We all enjoyed our lunch and milkshakes!!

Quieter as expected, really good ambience and the tables were distant for privacy. It was really comfortable. Food was served hot, quickly and no fuss. Menu is easy to understand, the server made a great effort in explaining and recommending various items on the menu. Every dish was flavourful. Good portion sizes, with great vegetarian selections as well.

Dishoom is consistent in its standard throughout all its restaurants in England, and never fails to impress on every visit. Service was really good! Food delicious too.. though it would have been nice to have more buns with the pau bhaji. The tandoori lamb chops were marginally too sour for our taste. Otherwise, the decor was beautiful and felt transported to old Bombay! My partner and I recently dined at Dishoom Birmingham and, despite a few minor inconveniences, our overall experience was outstanding, largely thanks to our incredible waitress, Serena. She adeptly addressed the hiccups, ensuring our evening was nothing short of memorable. Her extensive knowledge of the menu and excellent recommendations truly enhanced our dining experience.

The food was wonderful and full of flavor, making our dinner truly special. The atmosphere was vibrant, and even though the restaurant was busy, the staff were remarkably attentive and welcoming. The decor is beautifully done, paying a lovely homage to its Indian roots, adding to the overall charm. I highly recommend Dishoom Birmingham for a delightful culinary experience, exceptional service, and a warm, inviting ambiance! Lovely as usual. Not visited this location before but everything was perfect.
Didn't get to try the special so I will have to come back soon. The service was excellent as well as the food.
Looking forward to returning, and hopefully another winning roll 🤐

Thanks all We had the pleasure of dining at Dishoom with a very large group, and the experience was simply outstanding. The service was warm, attentive, and incredibly well-organized, even with our group size.

But the real highlight was the food, absolutely delicious! Every dish was bursting with rich, balanced flavours, showcasing a perfect blend of spices and textures. It’s rare to find Indian cuisine this vibrant and refined all at once.

A big thank you to the Dishoom team for a memorable evening.

It’s more the quality of food that is extremely bad, and this would be down to decisions at tactical/management level rather than an operational/store level issue. I’ve had better tasting coffee from sachets - if this is “Canada’s favourite coffee” then I feel sorry for the Canadians. The doughnuts all look wonderful, but they fall flat in the taste department- just tasteless bread, the manufacturing process needs to be reviewed. Personally will avoid this chain in the future. Haven’t been to Tim Hortons for years. Stopped by for a quick lunch during our visit to Birmingham and was a little disappointed. The doughnuts/tim bites didn’t feel too fresh and the onion ring were not crunchy.

Everything freshly cooked in house, portions are exceptional value, absolutely filling. Staff eager to help although very limited English. Menu is extensive but easy to order from. Downside is cash only.
Would very much recommend the chicken curry with egg fried rice, and equally the kung po chicken with egg fried rice.
Chopsticks and a spoon provided with every meal. Food is very good and affordable. Bento box is around £8 if you want noodles or egg fried rice. Have gone multiple times and would recommend. Been here multiple times now. Student friendly prices. Exceptional service , I always receive my order in under ten minutes! Today I waited two minutes for my customised order of rice to be cooked from scratch ! Fantastic place for students. It allows me to treat myself to a take out ❣️ 100% would recommend. Excellent ! Disappointed by the customer service. Mind you it's never been good but never this bad either.

They speak little English which is fine cuz you can just point at the menu but they treat non-Chinese customers differently. No basic customer service skills, no communication. The only times I've felt welcome here was when I would come with my Hong Kong friend. The girl who took my order looked almost bothered by my presence there but smiled at Chinese customers. Rude tone too.

Ordered kung pao chicken and the A1 option. When I got home I realized she didn't give me the chicken dish but another beef one. I don't know how she misunderstood since there's no beef dish next to it on the menu. They used to put a tea egg in the rice but not anymore which is disappointing. They sometimes give free soup with your order. Except that today I had to ask for it even tho the takeaway order before mine got free soup and so did everyone at the tables inside.

The food itself is good, tho the A1 option was just decent, the ""sauce"" is just red oil that sinks to the bottom and doesn't give much flavor so I wouldn't recommend it.

Overall, the cafe is very well presented throughout and I actually quite liked the pink theme. Very clean and professional. Cakes all looked amazing. The flavours were all fresh and well balanced - especially for my jasmine and lime iced tea. The cost is something I struggled to justify, if I’m honest - but I do feel overall it was worth it. Not somewhere I’d frequent, but is somewhere I’d visit again, if in the area. Delicious & trendy cafe
EL&N Café is definitely on the luxurious, more expensive side.
We tried the round croissants filled with pistachios and they were absolutely delicious – highly recommended! But all their cakes are pretty good.
Tea is served in cute pink pots - so if you are for all the Instagram picture hunt, that's your place.

Yes, it’s on the expensive side (around £7 for a croissant), and usually very busy, but it’s worth the wait if you’re in the mood for a treat in a trendy setting.
They have gluten free options as well. Really went to the Bull Ring for EL&N  to be honest as I was craving their cakes and drinks!!!

Absolutely fantastic! The owner is still very friendly too! I really hope it stays open for many years to come. “I recently had the pleasure of visiting City Kebab and Pizza House, and I have to say it exceeded my expectations!”  key aspects of the food that stood out to me – taste, presentation, freshness, or uniqueness. “The pizza was absolutely delicious! The crust was perfectly crispy, and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. I also tried their kebab, and it was juicy, tender, and packed with spices that gave it a delightful kick.” “The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, making the dining experience all the more enjoyable. Our waiter was quick to answer questions and offered great recommendations.” Ordered a bunch of items: Mix Doner Wrap, Hot Chicken Wings, Sausage, Spring Roll, Fish Cake and Potato Scallop. I would say the food quality was pretty average or even below average. The best food for me was the Potato Scallop, which surprisingly only cost 50p.

The menu is huge and the prices are very competitive. Maybe I should treat that as a warning sign for the quality? I also planned to have a try with their Cod and Pizza. But after the experience, I might change my schedule. Hopefully, I will not get sick after finishing all the items. Cash only, but the service was good.

There are definitely better alternatives nearby. Take your time and make your choice wisely. I have tried there masala fish made on grill with onion and chilli sauce it’s amazing chicken wings grilled nicely always fresh food.

We were greated by very friendly member of staff by the name of Megan.
She gave us time to study to the menu and she also offered advice on what was on some of the pizza's we were looking at.
Megan showed us the different size pizza boxes to give us an idea of how big the pizza's are. I decided that a small pizza was big enough for me however my partner decided he definitely needed a medium one 🐷
Megan was very helpful and found the best deals for us.
We were very happy we tge service we received 😀 Ordered a pizza and chips for takeaway and was really impressed. The service was quick, and everything was ready on time. Megan was super friendly and communicated everything clearly. Great experience overall – will definitely be coming back! Ordered a large pizza. Gave me a medium. Measured it: 11.5”…a large is 13.5”.

They were rudely defending their sizing. Gaslighting me. Then they called me up 5 mins later after I said I’d be filing a complaint, because why am I paying extra money for a smaller size, and they offered me a replacement. I took it.

The manager came outside my home to deliver a large pizza (finally) but with the wrong toppings. Couldn’t eat it.

Ridiculous. Not using this branch ever again. I’ve been waiting for my pizza for over 1.5 hours and it still hasn’t arrived. This is extremely disappointing.

So I had to do my friends shisha myself! Couldn’t even be bothered to ask for my money back. Awful. Wouldn’t recommend at all. Only one nice helpful staff member in a yellow hoody. Nice chap. But the rest awful! DO NOT COME HERE!! They put some nice decor and thought they could get away with dead shisha and terrible customer service. These man are buzzed and moody.

It’s lights, airy and lofty with a slightly industrial feel. The staff are helpful and friendly and although I didn’t have time to eat a lot, I can swear by the great quality of the sourdough toast and peanut butter and sweet potato fries. I wanted a more traditional Lal vegan breakfast but wasn’t keen on the Korean beans and parsnip snidely do played it safe. The batch brew filter looked insipid but was so good I ordered a refill. Loved the process. It’s a great location overlooking the period building on Chamberlain Square but I’m not sure where the nearest parking facilities are. It's hard to review places on Google Maps without seeming like a bot but...I'm no Jay Rayner..so can only offer my own balanced views really.
Firstly on the day we went the service was good, the typically Hipster looking server who met us was friendly enough. The croissant I had was extremely tasty and the coffee was most..ermm..coffee like. No real issues. Nice looking place as well with a nod to our fair city's brutalism. Will go back I was really looking forward to trying this café, but unfortunately, it turned out to be quite disappointing. We arrived around noon, yet several dishes on the menu were already unavailable — something you wouldn’t expect so early in the day.

The service also left a lot to be desired. The staff didn’t seem particularly engaged, and there was no manager around to speak to. My friend had to request a refund because the hummus and bread were stale and dry, and even asking for olive oil felt like an effort. Thankfully, the lady who processed the refund was polite and helpful.

As for my own meal, I ordered the Turkish eggs, but they were overcooked, dry, and a very small portion for the price. The chips were also overcooked. Overall, the food quality didn’t match the high prices — I spent £24 plus service charge, yet I don’t feel we received much service at all. On top of that, they had run out of oat milk but still charged for it.
The shakshuka has whole tinned tomatoes in it which is unusual just felt like it was just thrown in there. The chefs need to take pride in what they make on this occasion I don’t think they cared to be honest.

The only positives I can mention are that the café is spacious and the drinks were nice — I enjoyed my matcha and spending time with my friends. It’s a shame, because this place has potential, but right now it’s overpriced, underwhelming, and in defo need of improvement.
Maybe come here only for coffee/ matcha that’s about it really I’m sure there are better and nicer places instead. Wanted to make my own impression after seeing mixed reviews. Unfortunately didn’t make the cut. The layout is a bit weird with cakes in the window far away from the till. If you miss the coffee menu at the front, there isn’t any anywhere else either. The floor staff didn’t even say hi, but the barista made it up for them. You can use your own mug which is quite nice! But the latte was average.
The view is good but the place is not outstanding at all, and if anything they got room for improvement. Really like how you can order yourself with the QR code. Food came out fairly quick and tasted just as good,

Whether youre a student studying or out with your family or on your own, I'd 100% recommend this place. Stopped for a quick coffee while in the area. Lovely staff! Very friendly. Lots of tables

Beautiful coffee and hot chocolate (in photo) Cafe Face is a small, cozy spot that serves a quality cup of coffee. My go-to is a Cortado—though it's not listed on the menu, the staff gladly made one for me.

I didn’t try the full menu since I wasn’t very hungry, but I did have a raspberry and chocolate muffin. Both the coffee and muffin were brought to my table, and I was pleasantly surprised to see the muffin served on a warm plate—a thoughtful touch that added to the experience.

The café is located near the university and is popular with students. Listening to their conversations brought back fond memories of my own student days.

It’s not a full five-star experience, mainly due to the slightly steep prices—but overall, a charming place worth visiting.

Cortado + Coffee = £7.95 Very tasty food, good quality. The bacon was perfectly cooked. More expensive than a greasy spoon but it's a different offering.

Thank you again Mellows for personal attention and to say we will definitely be back and will bring out Meetup crew to enjoy the experience. I took the family and family friends for a graduation celebration meal. I was seated by Natty who has a lovely vibrant personality and seated us swiftly. We were them served by and incredible and energetic waiter by the name of Deejay (pls don't cuss me if I spelt that wrong) who made my parents and auntie extremely welcomed. They have expressed to me multiple times how enjoyable deejay made the entire experience. He really understood how to maintain and enhance the vibes and was also very respectful to my elders which I really appreciated, but also adapted his energy to myself and my younger cousin who had recently graduated.

Overall fantastic experience. Couldn't fault the wait times for seating, drinks or food. The staff were reasonably attentive without going overboard. My jerk salmon pasta slapped as did my 2-4-1 Mango Spice cocktail. Deejay you done convinced mom to return for another pina colada, she's your problem now 🤣

It was nice to be surrounded by your own culture, everyone in the restaurant took part in singing happy birthday to a table. the food good. The vibes good. The staff good.

I especially want to give a big shoutout to staff members — AGATQ , Mark and ABAD. They are incredibly friendly, attentive, and professional.

Highly recommend for any coffee lover! This was my first time trying Leon’s breakfast, and it was good. However, I found the portion size quite small for the price. That said, the food tasted great and was served quickly, which is perfect if you’re in a rush and need a quick start to the day. Overall, great staff and fast service! Honestly the best fast food service i have ever been to. The staff were very friendly and quick, there was a quiet, cosy and clean atmosphere and the food was 10/10. As someone who is gluten intolerant, it’s usually hard for me to have fast food and it be tasty and affordable but this place was spectacular. The food also contained the caloric and allergy/dietary requirement stickers on the menu which is very helpful. Definitely recommend and would come here again. Extremely fast service which was much welcomed given the rush I was in this morning. I ordered a bacon and egg muffin and for the price it was very good! Soft sourdough bun with an equally soft unsmoked slice of bacon, relatively thin “round” egg, and a dash of a sweet based ketchup to top it off and spinach. Would visit again, good fast service for breakfast. Love the decor of the place too!

Edit: added new photos on second visit

Also, noticed the “breakfast meal deal” which works out better value for money, in which any muffin with a regular coffee is £4.99! Only an additional 50p on the usual price of a muffin!

Service was extra fast again today too! I took my dog into Leon, Mari was so friendly and made us both very welcome and even helped me find something on the menu for my dog!

I’d really recommend going for a bite when Neha is working. The burgers were perfectly made and the bacon was crispy and salty without being dry. Best burger from Five Guys we’ve had in the UK so far.

Juicy fresh ingredients really makes a difference

And of course the milkshakes are really worth it. No other burgers compare to Five Guys! It is in a great location being right next to the train station, so you can stop by quickly before taking a train. The cajun fries are great, and they just dump them in there.

There was a long queue, and the staff seemed under a lot of pressure. It looked like they were short-staffed, and everyone was rushing around.

I’m a regular customer at this store, and I’ve noticed this happening more than once. I also have experience in the food industry, so I understand the importance of proper management. Some managers only care about getting bonuses👎 and don’t pay attention to the staff or service quality.

Used to live right by there but moved away and still order it! Fantastic delivery time, driver was really really nice. Jumbo Chinese Takeway also provided us with free wings which were amazing m. 100% recommend!! Friendly people. Food is usually good. Delivery person is polite, pleasant as is person who takes order.  No halaal options. Generous quantities. It’s closed on Tuesdays. Would recommend : Salt and Pepper King Prawns, Vegetable  Rice Noodles, Mini Spring Rolls. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE.

Me and my partner got a takeaway here. It was bland and cold, and we barely ate anything. Plus, I think it has given my food poisoning as within an hour of eating I have began to feel ill.

ChIJF5clh4O8cEgR-EskG0QqegY,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Clayton Hotel, Albert St, Birmingham B5 5JE, UK",4.3,2964.0,0.9625,5,5,0,0,52.4810539,-1.8905062,N/A,"Visiting the hotel was a truly delightful experience, and I would like to share my thoughts. From the moment I arrived, the welcoming atmosphere was immediately apparent. The staff members were exceptionally kind and went above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay. The room was well-appointed, offering a perfect blend of style and functionality. The bed was incredibly comfortable, contributing to a restful night's sleep. The hotel's amenities, such as the fitness center and restaurant, added to the overall enjoyment. The quality of the food and the service in the restaurant were both impressive and memorable. Overall, my experience was outstanding, and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Really enjoyed my stay at the Clayton Hotel Birmingham. The location is ideal — just a short walk from Birmingham New Street Station, Bullring shopping centre, and lots of restaurants and bars. Perfect base for exploring the city.

The room was clean, spacious, and modern with a comfy bed, good lighting, and a large bathroom. Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, and I appreciated the quiet despite being in the city centre.

Staff were friendly and welcoming throughout — check-in was quick and hassle-free. The breakfast buffet was generous with plenty of hot and cold options, and everything tasted fresh. Bar/lounge area was also great for a quiet drink in the evening.

No complaints — everything ran smoothly. Would happily stay again whether for business or a weekend trip. A very dependable and polished hotel experience. I recently stayed at this hotel and, unfortunately, had a less-than-ideal experience.

The room was uncomfortably hot, and the staff explained it was due to a climate-control system that adjusted to the outside weather. They did provide a portable fan, but it didn't fully resolve the issue. Additionally, the room lacked a fridge, which was inconvenient. On a positive note, the room itself was a good size and nicely decorated.

However, the staff's demeanor could have been more welcoming, which slightly dampened the overall experience. Great hotel located in the centre of Birmingham. I’ve stayed at the Clayton hotels across the UK. This has to be one of the best. It’s location is perfect if you are working or looking to spend some social time in Birmingham city Centre.

The rooms are relatively spacious with good bathroom and shower facilities. I was a little concerned that the work that is ongoing next to the hotel for HS2 would disrupt my stay, but actually the rooms are well soundproof.

Whilst the dinner options are basic and limited, they are good quality. The breakfast offered a good range of hot and cold, although my only criticism is that they were very slow to top of the hot options once they became empty. This was noticed on two consecutive days to the buffet. Hence my 4. Stars.

The reception staff were exceptionally helpful on arrival and departure. Ten minutes walk from train station, no parking nearby, but lots of local amenities, great restaurant, lovely bar area.  Staff very welcoming, apologetic for the roadworks taking place outside, not their fault but seemed genuine. Quick booking in process and fantastic room.

There was 10 of us and we also booked food. We sat upon the mezzanine area where you had a separate bar and toilet area from the main club. The food was nice, ate bread with salmon for a starter, lamb dinner with potatoes for the main followed by the cheese board. After eating the band starting playing and they were really good. We were able to leave our stuff at the tables whilst going down to the dance floor area, and return to the bar and toilet which was great as you avoided long queues. Overall it was a great night. Had fun last night. I went all by myself. Old folks who love live jazz and highlife music will enjoy the place better. The securities are good, bar tenders are nice. Overall 8/10 Fantastic venue. We visited for the acoustic night and it was well worth the trip. Great music, lovely friendly staff, and a super atmosphere. A must see for anyone who finds themselves in the area It appears the security here need to learn some simple manners. This security guard completely ruined my evening for my mother’s hen do and first experience of Jam House. There is a way to speak to people for a simple demand and also important to not intimidate people in doing so (still unsure why it took two of them to ask me to stand up). Likely won’t return. Usually a great night out but really disappointed today
Food and service was great but we booked for a soul night and the music was anything but soul. Resident duo
were below par   DJ also didn’t play soul and kept talking throughout the poor choice of music
Dress code was non existent and there was a group that were obviously not anywhere near twenty one. Finally the soul group arrived at eleven played briefly before leaving to say they’d be back in forty five minutes

I like the ambience and staff are lovely. Odeon also allows cold drinks from outside which is one of the best things about it as drinks sold here are priced exorbitantly high. Overall, its a top notch cinema for movies. Love it The screen was not big enough and didn't give a clear HD print. We went to see Jurassic World Rebirth and the show time was 8pm and we had to be there at 7.45, so we did reach in time but the movie started at 8.30 and it felt so loooong wait due to uncomfortable seats.. However the sound was good. Went to watch a movie yesterdey at this Odeon brand yesterday and what can I say. I was so appalled. The cinema itself is very outdated in my opinion. The screen was nowhere near as big as any other cinema I've been to as was the picture quality. Took me right back to the early 2000s and not in a good way!. The auditorium itself is outdated and the seats are uncomfortable. The way the seats are situated is at the same height as all the other rows. Therefore, the view is blocked by someone's head. I wouldn't go watch anything here again. Had not been for decades. Gladly I paid £5 only even then that's too much in my opinion. First of all the doorway is tiny as only one door is open and it's very inconvenient. It's not clear who you show your ticket to. The drinks were extremely overpriced. The seats in the cinema were disgusting, they're uncomfortable and hot due to the lack of air con. The screen was extremely bad quality, cut off weirdly, and extremely dark. Half of the speakers were off. The ceiling lights were constantly on. The adverts went on for way too long. Buying anything was difficult as the layout was very poor. And although it is not the cinemas fault, the people watching the film were constantly on their phones, talking, and getting up We went there for a foreign language movie and they killed the fun and experience by keeping the lights on.

However the room was a disgrace, there was a condom underneath the bed, now I never picked the bed up, I just moved it slightly across which the housekeeping should of done, there was a towel with a skid mark on it, I was absolutely disgusted.
Went to tell the bloke on reception and he just smiled and shrugged his shoulders, in the morning the West Indian lady was very nice she was very apologetic but this is unacceptable. Very friendly staff. Rooms for the price are absolutely fine. Warm fresh nice fully opening sash windows.
Stones throw from new street and bull ring.
All in all a delightful stay and would recommend 👌 Giving it two stars because it is a two star hotel and that's exactly what you get.  Single glazed sash windows, brown stain on the bathroom ceiling, antiquated lift, no food service.  The room was very clean however.  The staff were nice and it's right by the station.  Somehow I managed a decent night's sleep despite the air-conditioning units of the building next door going through the night.  Don't stay here unless you're prepared for the absolute basics.  I had to because it was works preferred choice because it's cheap. Awful and disrespectful owner/management
Checked in because of late trains the room was cramped carpet disgusting I wouldn't take my shoes off. Stench from drains made it an ordeal to use loo so much that I went to wetherspoons in the am for sponge bath and brush my teeth!!! Chair delapidated bad shape. I immediately complained and the night manager shrugged and said rooms cleaned everyday. Nothing I would have left but too late to book elsewhere so bared it requested refund was offered maximum of £15 disgusting. Checked in around 6pm. Could hear chap next door very clearly talking on his speakerphone. From inside the expected solitude of my room. Could hear him cough, rummage around, flick the light switch etc. Wasn't happy but it was just for one night and hoped he'd be gone or be asleep later. 1am, wake to hear the pleasant sounds of him snoring through the walls. Decided to notify reception so they can't say I should have told them about it at the time. Their response? ""Thank you for letting us know"". Literally.  No apology. No offer to change rooms.

We did end up having strawberry cheesecake (well my husband ate 99% of it!😂) and I had some really tasty chips
The venue was very clean and well laid out and having read the menu it is somewhere we would go back to where I'm sure a full meal would be great 😁
Thank you again This proved an interesting restaurant.
It's very attractive to visit.Excellent location for the hippodrome theatre.
They certainly coped with a busy pre theatre lunch session.Limited menu.
Staff were helpful,at times we felt at little over stretched.
Food,in the main all good.Little touches would have raised the bar.
The sea bass was very good,but had been dried out around the edges,from the pass,which given it was busy was odd.
Lasagna,good,but lacking that crispy finish.Not exceptional.
Everything arrived hot.
Calamari,good, little rubbery.
Things like putting olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the tables would be a nice touch.
Mains came with a salad
The desert's we had were excellent  have to say,my lemon based one,one of the best I eaten.
Tap water provided no problem.
Wines, delicious whites well chilled.
Price point above average to high for the quality.
But overall a lovely lunchtime experience.
Thank you.
We will visit again. Came with 3 friends and we had an amazing experience. The lobster risotto and whole lobster with fries are absolutely brilliant.

tables were all clean. Staff were very attentive helpful and pleasant.
Food was excellent,  everyone had different meals and there were no complaints from anyone, everything we had was cooked and presented lovely.
toilets could do with an update. my only dislike was that it was very noisy both with the punters and the music quite difficult to have a conversation. Lovely traditional pub, great food. The irish whiskey sauce I had with my steak (cooked perfectly medium rare) was absolutely banging (does come with mushroom, peas, tomato as standard but i didn't want them, fantastic staff! £3.75 a pint right in the heart of Birmingham City.

Definitely worth a visit, decent food, decent beer and friendly staff.

I challenge you to find a pint of beer of this quality at this price anywhere else in the city all day Monday to Friday

Update: I have revisited after a couple of months (which included wallet busting increases for hospitality employers such as minimum wage increasing and increases on NI plus costs of products reaching all time price highs) and what do I find when i arrive here? The price of a pint has come down by 35p on my aforementioned review.

Still giving the same amazing friendly service and now at £3.40 for a pint in the city centre while all others are starting to increase prices, makes this place a must visit.

Anyone catching a train from New Street and considering the pubs inside the station, this place is only a minute walk away and so much better.

Keep up the good work guys We’ve eaten here ALOT  as it is where we first met 27 years ago so the nostalgia is there for us.
Tonight we had some of the best food we’ve had here (we’ve had some good meals before) compliments to the chef, I am the fussiest person with my steak but it was spot on here.
Staff are lovely, we will be back (again) Went here before we headed to the theatre. We booked a table, when we walked in ans stated we'd got a table booked, they stated they hadn't printed the information off yet. When we were shown to the table the member of staff asked ""if you want me to clean the table, I will"" 😲 we only ordered simple meals fish and chips and a burger and chips but these took over forty minutes to cook! Oh ye, did I mention there was only one other table being occupied, so why the wait I'm not sure. We then placed an order for pudding, again simple, apple pie and custard and Brownie with ice cream, these took 28 minutes to be done, the member of staff did apologise but again for them to bang them in the microwave to heat surely shouldn't take this long...

We had the Birmingham Food Festival set course. Also came with an amuse bouche which was panipuri. Flavour profiles were amazing and portion sizes were bigger than expected. Curries could be spicier though! Good service (by Vivek & Akhter) and overall excellent experience. We went for the 6 course tasting menu experience.
It was a really nice experience, the food was nice but there were repeats on components across the experience.

The repetitive flavours were a let down but the overall quality, flavours and textures were nice and I would recommend people to try it. I also felt the dishes could use a tiny bit less salty. Let the other flavours shine!

We did also order 2 additional sea food dishes. The plating is super pretty.

I really enjoyed my mocktail and my king prawns.the dessert was super refreshing and light too. Our meal at Lasan was a Christmas gift (Gift card). The restaurant is very intimate and is beautifully presented.  The staff were very welcoming throughout the whole evening.  We arrived 30 minutes early and as it was quiet (Sunday evening) we were offered the option of being seated at our table or having pre-drinks in the bar, which we did - the best Passionfruit Martini I have ever had!  We were seated promptly at our table time and were brought a complimentary nibble with our popadoms, whilst we eagerly awaited our starter.  We chose a sharing platter starter of chicken, lamb, salmon and king prawn which was absolutely devine!  For our mains my husband chose a chicken dish in traditional curry style and I chose beef cheek on a dahl base.  This was accompanied by pilau rice, plain naan and peshwari naan.  Both dishes were excellent, although I was expecting the beef to have more Indian spicing - still delicious!  The naans were lovely and fluffy and very fresh.  Portions were very generous and we couldn't quite finish our dishes.  We both then enjoyed chocolate fondant desserts with pistachio ice-cream.  The evening was a real treat and we were looked after well by Vivek who regularly checked in with us to make sure everything was ok.  Would definitely return. Delicious Indian food. We got the chicken for starter and the salmon, amazing. We shared the butter chicken, the beef vindaloo and the lamb rogan josh. Really nice naan bread. We also had the gobi and aloo as sides.

Would definitely come back again.

The cocktails were delicious. The last night in Bombay amazing and I had a cocktail that tasted like a Pina Colada. Thank you to Arusha & Anshu for their wonderful service especially when they brought over a complementary surprise desert for my dad’s 85th birthday.

Food was great, beautifully presented and generous - although tailored to a more European palate in terms of level of spice.

This spot is a little off the beaten track and not too far from the Mailbox, but well worth a visit. Everything I had was absolutely delicious – proper finger-licking good! The selection of beers, ales, and ciders on tap was impressive. The staff were incredibly helpful and took the time to explain all the food and drink options, so I could make an informed choice. Great servers. Amazing gluten free food. Top notch ciders. We could do with this in London. Absolutely amazing no non sense food with a. Great vibe. Highly recommend to vegans and gluten free, soy free people everywhere Popped in for a quick bite as we were staying at the Holiday Inn for a night and this restaurant was a brief 5 minutes walk away.
We booked for 5pm and there were 3 of us.  Two of us had pizzas and one had nachos.  We shared garlic bread a portion of tater tots.
Service was swift and server was friendly, we were seated at a long table with benches, only downside was the noise from the tables either side, totally just a me issue though.
Food was really good, fresh, hot and huge portions.
Cost was reasonable £14 for the pizzas and  £12 for nachos.
All in all I would recommend a visit. Had a salad. I know, really let the side down on this one. But my friend said her pizza was delicious! (Actually she said one of the best she's had in Birmingham, but I can't verify because... salad). But I'll tell you what, if you like garlic bread, THIS garlic bread is unreal. We need it mass producing please. Pizza was incredible. The vegan option was great for my friend. Highly recommend keeping it simple and enjoying the dough/crust. The cider sampler was fun!

Food was just.ok so disappointed.
Very little on my bagel.
The poached eggs on my eggs royale were overcooked which meant the food very dry.
I didn't return it as I was late and was rushing.
Otherwise, it tasted good. Lovely food.  Good prices, especially for a city establishment The food we had was actually rather good. The service is another story! We were shown where to go by an ICC member of staff (very helpful chap) but the B:eats staff showed us to our table and then proceeded to completely ignore us for 30 minutes or so. Had to go and find a member of staff to take our order. Eventually, order taken; by friendly, other member of staff. Celebratory fizz came with dirty glasses, which I had to return to the bar. They only had two champagne glasses, so we ended up with wine glasses. No matter; they were clean! The food was good, and not expensive, so, although service iffy, all sufficed in the end. Handy location. Delicious fish and chips, the fish was really fresh and the batter was crunchy, plus the chips were crispy, not too floury and tasty  Great onion rings!  Very tasty mushroom and dolcelatte risotto. Quickly served too. Just don't sit near the doors in cold weather! I hate to write bad reviews, but I was utterly disappointed by this place. I and two other customers were supposed to sit and eat at a ""table"" where in fact there was only a sitting booth without any table. Only after asking for a proper table the staff reluctantly moved a table to the two other customers' booth and others were sent upstairs.

I really enjoyed every bite, smell and taste of each dish I had. Food was good, would rate it with 4 stars, however, the service was bellow average, you would expect more care and charm from the staff from a place with white tablecloths like that, especially when they add a 12.5% service charge on your bill.
As an example, the waitress dropped cutlery on the table whilst rushing to clear our plates and splashed my hair and dress with curry, but didn't seem very apologetic, only mumbled something about a wipe which I didn't understand - just wanted to leave at that point.
Overall, not sure if I'd come back. The place looks a bit dated and rundown (some seats were dirty, menu pages had folds and stains), not worth the money. For a dinner for 4 paid £150, so better off finding a local curry house.

There are notices  not to take pictures or film inside so an apology as i had already filmed a little before reading the notice. Definitely will come back to St Martins on my next visit. Thankyou to the lovely helpful staff. A peaceful historic gem in the heart of the city, St. Martin’s beautifully contrasts the modern Bullring around it. The Gothic architecture, stunning stained glass, and welcoming atmosphere make it well worth a quick visit or quiet moment of reflection. Perfect mix of heritage and serenity in busy Birmingham. St Martin in the Bull Ring is a beautiful and historic church located in the heart of Birmingham.

Built in the 19th century with stunning Neo-Gothic architecture, it features a striking 200-foot spire and intricate stained glass windows. Inside, visitors can admire the impressive timber roof and Victorian floor tiles.

The church is not only a peaceful retreat amid the busy city but also an active community hub, hosting regular services and events.

It’s a wonderful spot for both history lovers and those seeking a quiet moment in the city. Visited Friday lunch time. Wasn't busy at all. Very peaceful and quiet. We was greeted and felt welcomed.

The biggest problem with large chain enterprise, within time the product and customer service fades away.

Toby Carvery is no exception. We have supported Denham Toby Carvery for around 2 years, and recently after experiencing poor food and appalling service, we have decided to void Toby Carvery.

All too often, staff training and customer service is left behind when a brand grows.

4 months ago, we were told by the staff that the Toby Rewards Scheme had changed to 1 stamp per table. Now reading through Toby Carvery T&Cs there were no change, in fact the T&Cs clearly state “every paying customer buying a main is welcome to collect rewards stamps.

So, for 4 months we debated with the staff and constantly being refused a stamp. We decided to take the matter to the head office via their online complains option; 3 online complaints were made and every complaint was ignored! (yet another sign of a company not caring about customers)

We went online and after 13 messages and 2 weeks of complaining we finally were told that “every paying customer whom buys a main is entitled to a stamp… Well, done Toby Carvery, you don’t need to tell me, you need to train you staff properly? To think that we needed to speak with a total of 7 staff before someone knew how the rewards program worked, that’s how appalling the training is.

When we asked about the stamps we are owned, the reply: “you need to provide your personal bank statements so we can see you have eaten at Toby Carvery” Seriously: who do Mitchells & Butlers think they are? We are not providing bank statements but you can go check your own app as that’s where we make our bookings. Again, serious lack of training.

I’ve worked in hospitality for over 25 years and would never ask a customer for their bank statement, especially for something that is Mitchells & Butlers fault. We should be thanked for bringing the matter to their attention, not penalised.

Having supported Toby Carvery for so many years, it’s a shame to see the organisation deteriorate so rapidly.

On our last visit: The food was well below average and we didn’t recognise any of the staff. Our waiter was on his 1st ever shift with no waitering experience and had limited knowledge. The poor lad really was struggling but the limited training he had was all wrong, He too, had been told 1 stamp per table… Can’t win.

The food was absolutely appalling. The beef was cheap fatty cut and not been cooked long enough. To say it was chewy would be an understatement. In fact, we could hear other tables complaining about the beef. The vegetables were over cooked and bland.  Their version a cheese sauce, was nothing more that cheese melted over cauliflower, with pumpkin slices!! More like hospital food than a restaurant. The pigs in blankets were an embarrassment, floating in oil absolutely disgusting. The entire meal was an embarrassment to the hospitality industry.

Once we experience the appalling behaviour from their head office, we knew it was time to leave Toby Carvery to their disgusting food, poor training and ridiculously informed staff on line and go elsewhere.

It is rare for me to write a poor review, but I don’t like being conned with misinformation, I don’t like untrained staff being left on their own, I don’t like below average food and I certainly do not like companies that ignore their customers. To ask a customer for their bank statement is unforgivable This is nothing to do with a place but the company it's self. We had a £50 gift card gifted to us from a family member. We had the receipt everything but the money was not on the card when we tried to pay. Since December we have been trying to get it sorted via the company, they said it was a supplier fault, the supplier said it's the company at fault. We have heard back again today after  months of waiting that the company are not going to do anything. So they have been given £50 for nothing and we are left with a gift card of no use.
Do not use this company for it's gift cards, they wash their hands of you when they have had they money. To top it all off it's taken them 4 months to come back with this answer.
Give money instead a gift card from here it's safer and you know you will be able to use it Ordered a pint, the crown of my precious and irreplaceable oak tree to be trimmed, and instead had the tree cut down. Pint was middling. Can’t recommend. Just a heads up some people are going to your restaurant using reservations under names that aren’t their’s. I live in the United States and apparently have a reservation for February 23rd at 14:15. Tried to find other ways to reach out but this was the only way I could find to reach you. Visted toby carvery streetly sutton coldfield absolutely shocking had to go to the bar and order own drinks no table service at all didn't even come round to clear thr plates or offer deserts shocking.

Most recently, I tried the Bubble Fizz Strawberry drink, and it was really nice—refreshing and full of flavour.

Service here is generally fast and the staff are quite helpful, even when it's busy (which it often is depending on the time and day). The main downside is the lack of seating. If you're visiting with kids or hoping to sit and relax, you might be better off getting your drinks to go, especially during peak times.

Overall, a solid spot for bubble tea lovers! Disappointed with Service and Quality at Bullring Branch

I visited the Bullring Bubbleology branch on 28th June and was quite disappointed with the experience. Upon arrival, I was greeted by an older gentleman standing at the counter with the menu turned off. He informed me, rather abruptly, that “we only have fruit teas.” I accepted that and proceeded to place my order. However, the drink I received was room temperature and tasted like tap water with some popping boba – not what I expect from a £5 bubble tea. It was so underwhelming that I ended up throwing it away.

Hoping this was just an off day, I returned during the following week and had a much better experience. I was greeted politely by a young lady with glasses and a long name, who was professional and courteous. This time, I ordered a mango milk tea and it was cold, flavourful, and actually worth the money.

I understand if a store is running low on ice or ingredients – these things happen. But being served a warm fruit tea at 4pm, when the store closes at 8pm, just comes across as careless and lazy. I hope management ensures a more consistent level of quality and service across all shifts. I came in for a drink about an hour ago with my friend and saw the manager loudly yelling at a staff member. It felt quite unprofessional to handle such a matter in front of customers, as it not only created an uncomfortable atmosphere but also undermined the worker's dignity. Shame on the manager! Brilliant and knowledgeable service by:  shan + imaan. I was recommended banoffee pie supreme cold with cream and tapioca, it was 'banoffilant'. 10/10 I will be back again. 👍😀
I went after 6pm and they were still happy to serve which was a suprise considering how busy the place is. Must try! Sameer and  Shohaib were fantastic, they helped me pick a good flavour mix whilst considering my allergies and diet requirements. The drink was really well made and I was also offered to sign up to their loyalty programme.

Was served by Jessie, she was lovely and so chatty! Gave me a great song recommendation too! Made my day :) In a really hot and boring day, I asked one of the best staffs there who named Mehrdad, what do you recommend? He recommended the Iced white  mocha to me, it was absolutely the nicest coffee I have ever had in my life and really made my day, thanks to Mehrdad and his team I came as a customer and placed my order around 8:20 a.m. I told the partner at the POS that I would like a blonde roast, ristretto shots, and oat milk.

They told me at the POS that they do not accept the Starbucks app, which meant I did not get 30% off and had to pay £6.95, which is about £2.00 more than at other stores. I agreed and paid for my order.

At that price, I was at least expecting my order to be correct. The order was passed on to a partner called Bertrik who made my order with ordinary milk, I did ask if it was made with Oat milknandnhe confirmed it was. I did ask for cream; however, he put the cream on the inside of the lid and not on the actual drink. I have never seen that before, so that shocked me. The drink was spilling over the edge of the cup when he finished, and he just passed it to me in a mess, which I had to wipe and clean.

I noticed straight away that before he put the lid on, the top of the drink was pure white. With oat milk, you get a yellow color on top, not white. Also, when I started to drink it, there was no oat milk taste at all, which again is not normal.

I took about three sips and stopped drinking it. I had to go to catch my coach but overall felt like I had been ripped off.

After about 15 minutes, my stomach started to ache as I am lactose intolerant, I can only have a little lactose before it starta hurting my stomach.

Also, on my visit, cross-contamination was witnessed. Bertrik made a frappuccino with a blender that previously had cookies and cream in it and did not wash it before use. My thought at that time was, ""If he is doing this, then he must be doing this with all the pitchers too."" This is a huge concern, imagining that my drink was made in a picter that had not been washed all morning was not a lovely picture in my head.

I hope you take this seriously. I have attached a photo of my Grande white mocha in this email.

Also No name on cup! No thank you on hand off.

Also did not ask for XH! The employee's attitude is absolutely the worst.she might be going through a difficult time.

She was professional, clear in communication and always quick to respond to my questions. As someone new to the UK, I really appreciated how she guided me through each step and made the process feel easy and stress-free.
Would definitely recommend her and Savills to anyone looking to rent. I would highly recommend Savills. I have been with them for 3 years and have always found them to be reliable, responsive and helpful in all things. I recently requested a viewing of a new property and Varinder was brilliant. She was knowledgeable about every question asked, showed me each aspect of the property and gave me the confidence in specifics I wanted to ask about. Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you Varinder I would highly recommend Savills, we had the best experience!  In our situation of being foreigners buying real estate in UK, agent Joe Shorney did an incredible job of helping us with every step, completely reliable and professional. We had zero struggle because he did everything he could in our favour. Simply the best! We recently bought an apartment with Savills as the real estate agent. We dealt with Isaac Burner throughout the entire process, from the initial viewings to getting our keys. Isaac was incredibly friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. This was our first time purchasing a property and he made us feel at ease throughout the entire process. He was always available to get in contact with and helped us every step of the way. We could not recommend Savill’s and Isaac more! Mr Vijay Kapila from Property Management conducted my flat inspection earlier in the week and I was most impressed with the level of attentiveness during this process - both in following the procedures and in answering my multitude of questions (for my better comprehension) regarding my tenancy and experience since moving at this property.
Mr Vijay Kapila also showed a great level of respect towards me and my home and this has made a standout difference!

Ordered food and a drink. They forgot the drink.

Asked for sauce. They forgot that too and when I went up to the bar to ask again, was told ‘not to stand too close to the bar entrance’.

Woeful. Staff training desperately needed.

Steak was ok though. Onion rings oily. Came exactly per order - steaks done the way we asked for though one came with a slightly heavier sear but all still good. Chips were chef's kiss.

I liked the fact it was next to the canal alongside the Black Sabbath Bridge.  A few steps at the one entrance but a level access around the other end of the building.  Also disabled toilets. We liked the fact that they do cater for children and they have there own little menu. The staff were friendly and chatted easily with us. Telling us about the entertainment they have on weekends.  I noticed quizzes too. So a good all round family fun pub. We really enjoyed our food. And can't wait to visit again. 👍🏻 The environment and atmosphere of the pub is really nice, it’s cozy and it has comfortable seating, you can also order from your table. There is air conditioning inside and there is a nice small seating are outside right next to the canal
HOWEVER, we got 2 of the Black Sabbath IPA English Ale ( based on the description given from the bar staff) however the beer was disgusting, flat and not cold and did not look anything like the beer that was advertised outside the pub ( picture from the beer and the advertisement are posted ). We asked the manager (Chris) if we can get a different beer as it was not what we thought we ordered. I was told that the sign outside doesn’t say that that the beer looks like that (very misleading). Chris told us that he can’t give us a different beer or a refund and that we should have asked to try it before buying it. His tone was very dismissive and he didn’t really care. Stopped in for a cold pint of Black Sabbath IPA to honour Ozzy Osbourne's funeral procession in Birmingham.

Good pint. Fast service and it was packed 👍 Went there for Sunday afternoon gig. It was a great atmosphere, with a friendly crowd Good choice of beers..  and while I didn't eat, pub grub meals..as well as a Sunday roast are available. Friendly service and decent beers on. Great location, nicely done up inside, and plenty of seating. Only popped in for a pint so can't comment on the food.

Kids menu was good value and we enjoyed the new honey chicken. It was a little fatty in places and the gyoza could have been cooked a little more. Really attentive staff who looked after us throughout and made sure we had a nice table and were happy with everything.
Fast turnaround on freshly cooked food and lots of options. Would recommend for families needing gluten and non-gluten containing options. The experience here was okay, but could have been better. While waiting for a table for two, we stood in the cold lobby area between the restaurant's outer doors and inner doors. However, we did not wait for long.

Our dishes arrived at separate times which was irritating. My teriyaki soba with chicken breast tasted bland. The chicken was very dry. I ended up pouring generous amounts of soy sauce and chili oil sauce over the whole dish. The coconut reika ice cream wasn't what I expected. It tasted like a protein shake powder. Great staff, fast service and amazing food what else can you ask for. I was invited by my friend who had food there before and recommended that we should meet up at Wagamama for our next meal.

The food was great!
There was someone at the door for meet and greet - very friendly girl who I just said that I am here to meet up with my friend .
She directed me to our table , my friend was already there.

There are vegan and normal menus on the table.

The dishes are explained well as the names of the dishes are a just little difficult to pronounce. They have dish number too so solved the problem for me!

Also, the table assistance was great.

Perfect for a nice relaxed afternoon if you go during the week, I imagine it's quite a bit busier on the weekends and school holidays.

Be aware that the hot-houses are very hot and humid! Probably 30-35? so if you go in the colder months make sure you can remove some layers easily.

The grounds are broadly wheelchair accessible, with sloping ramps. Although if possible take someone who is able to open doors as one door in the cacti room to an accessible ramp does get stuck and some slopes (while gentle for those walking) could be a little steep for a manual chair.

Plenty of benches around, some in the sun and some in the shade as well as a large gazebo-like structure near the rose garden you could duck into if it rains.

Perfect for kiddos, if you park yourself in the cafe with a view to the hothouse door you can safely send them off on their own to run around for hours. There is a plat area as well if that's more their thing than running through bushes.

Love the little shop, lots of gardening bits as well as cards, pottery and artwork all priced fairly high as you would expect for any garden centre/ public attraction.

The cafe seems well enough, again watch out for your wallet as the cakes on display look delicious! Wonderful place we spent whole afternoon inside. Lots of plants to discover and different types of trees and flowers we never know. Quiet and peaceful place. Really nice along with lovely gifts to get in the shop. Weekend in Birmingham kicked off with a visit to this beautiful place.

I recently spent a beautiful day exploring Birmingham Botanical Gardens, followed by a delightful brunch at Medicine Bakery—and I couldn’t recommend the combination more!

The Botanical Gardens were absolutely stunning. From the moment you step in, you're greeted by peaceful pathways, lush greenery, and glasshouses filled with exotic plants from all around the world. Each section felt like its own little ecosystem—whether it was the tropical house with giant palms and koi ponds, or the arid house showcasing cacti and succulents. It’s an ideal spot for a quiet walk, a bit of inspiration, or even just to unwind with nature.

The space is bright and modern with a creative vibe—housed in a former gallery—which adds to the atmosphere.  the pastries at medicine bakery are genuinely next-level.

All in all, it made for a perfect half-day escape—nature, culture, and seriously good food. Whether you're a local or just visiting Birmingham, this duo should be high on your list. I just love this place. Love the gift shop, the cafe, the botanicals especially the tropical plants section and their carnivorous plants bit as well and the Japanese garden.

My first venture into Elio Cafe, nestled in the heart of the Mailbox, proved to be a truly delightful experience. Stepping inside, I was immediately struck by the sophisticated atmosphere. The interior design is undeniably beautiful, with a clear emphasis on creating a refined space. The high ceilings are a masterstroke, instantly lending an air of grandeur and elegance that elevates the cafe beyond your typical coffee stop.
While the artwork adorning the walls and ceilings might be described as simple, its execution and placement are anything but. It's clear a thoughtful hand has curated the decor, achieving a sense of visual harmony that is both calming and aesthetically pleasing. The lighting further enhances this carefully crafted ambiance, creating a warm and inviting glow throughout the cafe.
The attention to detail extends to the furniture. The variety of seating options is a testament to the owner's understanding of different customer needs and preferences. Crucially, all the furniture I observed appeared to be of high quality, adding to the overall impression of a well-considered and upscale establishment. It's evident that the owner has invested significant effort in creating a unique and appealing environment, setting Elio Cafe apart from the competition.
Although I didn't sample the array of snacks and desserts on offer during this visit, a quick glance at the neighbouring tables was enough to impress. The cakes and pastries looked tempting and clearly well-received, suggesting a high standard of quality in their culinary offerings.
My focus on this occasion was the coffee, and I opted for an Americano with milk. I was not disappointed. The coffee was genuinely excellent, possessing a distinct and memorable flavour profile. It had a unique character that hinted at a blend  I hadn't encountered before, leaving a lasting positive impression.
Beyond the impressive aesthetics and quality coffee, the staff at Elio Cafe truly contribute to the positive experience. Their friendly and courteous demeanour made my visit even more enjoyable. Their attentiveness and welcoming attitude added a layer of warmth to the already pleasant atmosphere.
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Elio Cafe to anyone venturing into the Mailbox or even the wider Birmingham City Centre area. It's more than just a place to grab a coffee; it's an experience. The combination of elegant design, a thoughtfully curated ambiance, excellent coffee, and friendly service makes it well worth a visit. Elio Cafe has certainly earned a spot on my list of go-to cafes in Birmingham. Love this cafe, has a great vibe not to loud nor is it silent. The beverages are great my personal favourite is a strawberry matcha. Overall, price point is great. The workers are lively and respectful particularly, Zoe, who help with drink recommendation and excellent customer service! I recently visited Cafe Elio, and I must say it was an excellent experience. The cakes, especially the cheesecake, are absolutely delicious. The creamy texture and perfect sweetness make it a must-try. Their coffee is also top-notch, with a rich flavor that pairs perfectly with the desserts. The prices are very reasonable, which makes it even more appealing.

The ambience of the cafe is charming and cozy, with soft pink tones that create a warm and inviting atmosphere. It's a lovely space to relax and enjoy your treats.

The cocktails were just as impressive – vibrant, tasty, and strong enough to get the night started right. The atmosphere was lively and welcoming, with friendly staff who made the whole experience even better. Highly recommend for a fun night out with great food and drinks! Thanks to Shyan for looking after us :) Food and cocktails were fabulous at the bottomless brunch . I had the chicken jerk roti with sweet potato fries which was delicious. Jai was our server and she was attentive, friendly and amazing. She needs a pay rise as she is so good. Xx will be back very soon. Josh, Roman & Alex were the best hosts we could ask for. First time visiting and they made the visit special. Very efficient, caring and friendly. Cannot fault them. Will be back soon! Absolutely amazing! Had Gio as our waiter and he always made sure our drinks were full. So polite and friendly. Would 100% recommend the bottomless brunch. I came here for the first time today and enjoyed the wonderful atmosphere and great service by Blake our server who was very knowledgeable about the food and drinks choice and even gave me a complimentary dessert 🍰 as it was my birthday 🥳

Lovely beer garden, great drinks prices and really friendly staff. After reviewing the cleanness of the bar and toilets I can only imagine that the rooms are spotless. Very well run establishments. I look forward to going back to here if my work takes me to the area again. When I booked this it was just a place that was the cheapest!! However I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The rooms are large, comfortable beds and great showers facilities. I ate in the pub in the evening and I really enjoyed the meal. The bar staff, check in staff and the chef were all really helpful and wonderful to chat too. It's so refreshing to go to a place of stay and not knowing the area and the staff make you feel so welcome.  The staff are a credit to your business. Thank you very much and I will definitely be returning. Perfect from start to finish. It was an enjoyable 2 nights. The location is great as you are only about 10 minutes' walking from the coach station and 15 minutes to train station. Free car park for guests. I will be definitely back soon. The Moseley Arms, Birmingham: A Decent, No-Frills City Stay 4/5
The Moseley Arms offers a practical and generally pleasant experience for a city centre stay in Birmingham, earning a solid 3 out of 5 from my visit. It's a good choice if you prioritize convenience and a lively atmosphere over luxury, but it does come with a few caveats.
The Good:
* Location is King: Without a doubt, the prime advantage of The Moseley Arms is its location. Nestled in Digbeth, it's incredibly close to major transport links like Moor Street and Grand Central stations, making arrival and departure a breeze. For those heading to the Custard Factory or O2 Institute, or simply wanting to explore the Bullring, it's perfectly situated for easy access. The free on-site parking is also a significant bonus in such a central area.
* Friendly Faces: The staff deserve a special mention. They were consistently welcoming, helpful, and efficient, contributing significantly to a positive overall impression. Service at the bar and check-in/out was always prompt and friendly.
* Pub Vibe: If you appreciate a traditional pub atmosphere, you'll feel right at home. The bar area is lively, offering a good selection of drinks. We didn't sample the full food menu beyond some snacks, but the general buzz was enjoyable.
The Alright (and what holds it back from a higher score):
* Room Comfort (Just About): Our room was clean and had the essentials – an en-suite, TV, and tea/coffee facilities. However, it was fairly basic. While perfectly adequate for a short stay, the general wear and tear were noticeable, and a refresh wouldn't go amiss. We also found the sound insulation to be a bit lacking, meaning we could hear some of the pub's activity and fellow guests, though it wasn't overly disruptive during our midweek stay.
* Breakfast (Average): We opted for breakfast, which was convenient but fairly standard fare. Nothing to write home about, but it filled a gap before a day of exploring. It's an additional cost, and while not unreasonable, it didn't feel like particularly good value for what was offered.
* Noise Potential: While we didn't experience excessive noise, it's clear that on a weekend, with live entertainment running, this could be an issue for light sleepers. During our stay, the general pub chatter was audible but not intrusive.
The Verdict:
The Moseley Arms is a perfectly decent option for a short, functional stay in Birmingham, especially if you're attending an event nearby or just passing through. Its fantastic location and genuinely friendly staff are its strongest assets. However, don't expect a luxurious or particularly quiet retreat. It does what it says on the tin – a convenient city pub with rooms – and for that, it earns a solid 4 out of 5. This place offers clean and well presented accomodation which is reasonably priced.
It provided everything we needed for a short stay. Staff were friendly and attentive to our needs. The price reflects it's location which is on the periphery of the city centre and appears rather run down. but is in the process of transition. It is about a 20 minute walk to the City Centre and main attractions.
The pub provides meals which we did not try and sadly breakfast is only served on a Sunday.

It looks small from the outside but they actually got lot of seating inside and have a terrace. It’s great vibe and the food was great tho it may not be my fav cuisine. The staff was really nice. Overall definitely recommend giving it a try especially the fries! Can't recommend this place highly enough!
The food is tasty and filling. I had the beef and cheese tapioca crepe ( a bit like a tortilla) and a chicken croquette (again using tapioca). Don't be put off by the tapioca, it's good and chewy. We had a salad with it and a pineapple and mint juice.
We sat out in the yard in the sun to eat our food.
Also, my other half left her bag on the chair when we left and twenty minutes later, we passed by the restaurant and she came out and handed it over.
Great people. Great food. Great vibe. Stepping into this café felt like being transported straight to a Brazilian coffee shop. After 10 years, I finally found a proper Brazilian coxinha, flavorful, and absolutely delicious! The food was outstanding, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. A truly authentic  Brazilian experience! Lovely place! I had a tapioca crepe, and it was delicious (even the dressing on the side salad!). My coffee was also excellent. I will be back to try the other menu items and desserts. The gentleman serving me was very welcoming and friendly. I've visited this place twice now and on both occasions I'd recommend.

The first time was for food and we sat inside. It was delicious and arrived quite quickly.

The second time was for take away drinks and we sat inside while we waited. It was a bit longer for the drinks but they were excellent (I think mine was mint/cucumber? Can't remember as it was a while ago now, but it was very refreshing). It was perfect for a warm day as we walked around in the sun after. The staff was also very friendly and made us feel very welcome. I'd love to bring some friends here for a proper sit down meal but so far we haven't had the chance!

Food was hot, dumplings a little tough, curry mutton was good, and boneless which is good for my wife who doesn't enjoy bone in food.
Wings were OK, but quite salty flavoured.
We got 40% off with JustEat on this order, and that is about what the food was worth. If I had paid full menu price, I would have been very unhappy. Looks good from the outside, but the ratings say it all. I ate here recently and was very disappointed. Firstly, they didn't acknowledge me as I waited to be served. I was waiting for at least 5 minutes before I got fed up and asked for service.  I selected my dish and paid. I paid more than the average price for the food, so here's me expecting a more generous portion with explosive flavours, but the portion was less than the average portion and the flavours were bland or overpowering. The oxtail was more bone than anything, and the steam veg portion was minimal. The rice lacked flavour, as did the meat, and I was just really disappointed. Then, I decided to order a piece of jerk chicken from the drum outside. That came to the table, and it wasn't steaming like the other food. Tasted it, and it was cold. When I then told the young woman the chicken was cold, she then went on to lie to me and tell me it had just come off the drum from outside. I'm certain that did not just come off the drum from outside as  it was cold and did not taste fresh. I wouldn't eat here again as there is nothing authentic about this shop or the food, and the young woman who lied to me did kill any hopes of a better rating. There was a young black guy in there who, if I weren't for him, then I would give this place the lowest rating possible. He made the experience enjoyable for me by asking me if the food was alrite and if I needed anything else and just generally a well-spoken, attentive, polite young man. Avoid this place if you can, as you will be greatly disappointed if you taste their so-called authentic food. Also, the price paid and the food of that low quality. Not again I went against my better judgement, didn't listen to the reviews and now I'm sat here hungry and vex. Caribbean Twist  you  CAN NOT COOK CARIƁBEAN  FOOD. Just call your shop Twist.  My lamb was dry and tough  the jerk ribs was burnt and tough. Caribbean food is more than just a bit of seasoning and chuck Ordered on uber eats at midnight. Never got my food despite waiting 2hours.
Called the store, they argued that the delivery driver could not get past the barrier whilst that not being my location and letting me wait. They also decided to gaslight me and then admitted to it.
After tried to reason with them they agreed to refund me.
I called the store again after 10mins, they decided to gaslight me again saying that I needed to cancel the order and it get refunded or pay £2 pounds extra to get the order. They also asked me to go to the shop tomorrow to see that the food was cooked, knowing that was not the problem. I see that as a safety issue.
Didn’t get to try the food but seeing how the shop talks to its customers, I am sure 2 stars is overrating this store. I’m so disappointed, I’m Jamaican and I’m actually shocked at how dry and plain the food is. The dumpling should be nice and crispy but it’s soft on the outside. I was looking forward to eating the Mac and cheese but the Mac and cheese coming like it was cooked a week ago, then got put into a freezer and then warmed up and served for me. The mac and cheese has no flavour at all. Worse max and cheese I’ve ever tasted. Ontop of that I order Victoria cake they gave me some type of cheese cake. The only two things that is decent is the rice and peas and the fries.

Part 1:

📝: This restaurant/bar opened in Jewellery Quarter in Birmingham a couple years ago. Because my first visit was amazing and I couldn’t fault it, I decided to revisit. However, the  expectation second time round fell short.

The service on a whole was not good. After the waitress took the orders the menu’s were left on the table, empty glasses were also left on the table for the duration of the meal.

When I received my starter 2 hours later it was cold, I also had to wait around 45 minutes to receive drinks. However the cocktails were tasty and we were offered complimentary drinks for our wait.

🍴Starters
- £5.50 Spicy Chicken strips - coating had good flavour, I would order it again, but didn’t like the pepper sauce.

- £6.75 Fricassee chicken wings - balance of flavours was good , the depth of flavours was great you could taste everything you would want in a dish , the food definitely hit the mark.

- £6.75 Barbecue chicken wings - I liked the sweet taste of flavours, it melts in your mouth.

- £8 Jerk King prawns and Avocado salad - was tasty and flavoursome, cooked to perfection a really good dish

- £8 Coconut crisp prawns - They were nice and crispy but needed more coconut as I couldn’t really taste it, the peppered sauce was way too spicy didn’t really like it and it did not go well with the dish. I would of preferred a different sauce.

📝: part 2 - When I received my main course 3 hours later it was warm I was not impressed. I did feel like they struggled to cope with the pressure on Mother’s Day. I would not be in a rush to return as our experience this time round was not a good one. Considering it was Mother’s Day I was extremely disappointed.

🍴Mains
▪️£11.95 Veg curry - It was alright not bad, I would of pereferred potato and yam in the curry but it was just garden veg and peppers , seasoned rice needed a little bit more season as  it was very bland.

▪️£16.95 Peppered steak & white rice - Steak has a sweet taste not spicy , nice strong flavours, the rice was very fluffy And the veg was flavoursome

▪️ £22.95 Steak & rice n peas - my mom ordered the steak cooked medium rare , she was impressed with flavours of the dish especially the mushroom sauce which she thought was lovely and she enjoyed the cherry tomatoes was really tasty

▪️ £14.95 Fried chicken & rice n peas - Chicken & rice was dry needed gravy , food was also warm not hot enough . I would not order it again however the rice n peas was nice and fluffy, if it had gravy it would of gone down like a treat .

🍴Sides
▪️Dumplings  I wish they were cooked fresh as we did wait more than 2 hours for our food

▪️Mac n cheese - this was is nice not too creamy the consistency is  just right , the plantin was sweet but it was hard so not very enjoyable , I would of liked it more soft. Colsesaw I didn’t really like it didn’t give me the wow factor.

▪️£14.95 Bbq chicken & rice n peas - it was nice nothing special, i found it to be warm And I like my food hot with the steam coming off it.

We were all full after eating our lunch. I would recommend trying the food at Devon House Jamaican Restaurant, I will certainly be going there again. We are visiting Birmingham once a year, every year  and we are always trying small local independent restaurants during our stay.
We had a number of small dishes as we wanted to try few of them due to the mixed reviews. Every dish was lovely, beautifully spiced and a culinary delight. I loved the oxtail dish with its rich flavours and literally falling off the bone.
The reason I’m only giving 4 stars for service is because we needed to prompt the girl who served us for side plates as we were sharing and cutlery after she cleared the table first time. Considering the restaurant wasn’t busy, the oversight was slightly unacceptable, but she did make sure to ask that everything was ok afterwards.
Overall, great meal, lovely hosts who made us feel welcomed as soon as we came in but also taking the time to talk to us at the end.
Worth a visit, we thoroughly enjoyed the delicious dishes. I didn't see salted chicken on the menu, but that's what I received.  No comparison to Caribbean & Cocktails where the service was amazing.

5 people, only 1 of us enjoyed the meal.
I was told I should have complained at the start of my meal. Thing is, I wouldn't have eaten anything this restatenot  had to offer.

25% us what they offered. We removed the gratuity fee.

A long wait for your meal. Yuk .
We was welcomed by a lovely young lady who gave us her divided attention which was very nice and appreciated.
The cocktails taste nice but less ice would have been appreciated
The starter of chicken wings was nice with a lovely sticky sauce.
We had the salmon for the mains with vegetables. The salmon was a very small portion and very little flavour and vegetables were bland and again no flavour.
I applaud the business but try to do a little more with the food as I would like you to prosper as I black restaurant and I will come again.
I hope to see you again soon.",1.0,0.0,"[""Chinese"", ""Indian"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Dessert"", ""Seafood"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Steakhouse""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Special Occasion""]","['rice', 'rice peas', '95', 'peas', 'caribbean', 'flavours', 'chicken', 'sauce', 'received', 'chicken rice']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Steakhouse"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""chicken rice"", ""Service"", ""rice"", ""Dessert"", ""sauce"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""chicken"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Waiting Time"", ""flavours"", ""Portion Size"", ""peas"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""95"", ""caribbean"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Seafood"", ""Fast Food"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Indian"", ""rice peas"", ""Chinese"", ""Special Occasion"", ""received"", ""Experience""]"

Each time, I was fortunate to be treated by George, and I can’t speak highly enough about the exceptional care he provided. George is an outstanding physiotherapist, his expertise, professionalism, and dedication helped me recover quickly and effectively without having to take a break from my workouts and sports. His approach is both efficient and straightforward, making the recovery process seamless. If I ever need physiotherapy again, George will undoubtedly be my first choice. Highly recommend! I started seeing Isaak for persistent lower back pain caused by heavy lifting over five years ago. For the longest time, I thought I'd just have to live with it. But after working with Isaak to improve my mobility, strengthen supporting muscles, and stretch the area around the injury, I'm now mostly pain-free.

The process took just a few months, but the impact has been life-changing. I can finally sleep through the night without discomfort, and I can work without pain—even during long periods of sitting.

Isaak is a great physio, and I’d highly recommend him to anyone dealing with chronic pain. Huge thanks for all the help! I had an outstanding experience at Edgbaston Physiotherapy. The clinic was spotless, well-organised, and provided a professional yet welcoming atmosphere. I worked with Geoffrey Yu, who was highly knowledgeable and quickly identified the root cause of my issue. The expertise and patient centred approach has made a real difference in my recovery. I highly recommend them. Very professional, respectable and knowledgeable in all aspects. I've been going here for over 7 years to work on my rehab of my achilles, knee and calf injuries and isaac has looked after me, giving me the best advice on recovery and ways to strengthen to get me back to back playing in the sports I am involved with. Highly recommended if anyone would like to get back to living pain free. Service is the best I came for a rotator cuff injury and in less than 3 months it was gone. Not only did I receive great treatment and a list of effective gradual exercises but knowledge on the injury itself.

ChIJJXnNH_S8cEgRDmaig_6vKxU,Gourmet Burger Kitchen,"Unit 4, The Waters Edge, Brindley Pl, Birmingham B1 2HL, UK",4.5,1627.0,0.90724,5,5,0,0,52.4779643,-1.9118568,"[""Monday: 11:30 AM – 9:00 PM"", ""Tuesday: 11:30 AM – 9:00 PM"", ""Wednesday: 11:30 AM – 9:00 PM"", ""Thursday: 11:30 AM – 9:00 PM"", ""Friday: 11:30 AM – 9:00 PM"", ""Saturday: 11:30 AM – 9:00 PM"", ""Sunday: 11:30 AM – 9:00 PM""]","We stumbled across GBK in Brindley Place after work and saw they had 50% off burgers – the perfect excuse to finally try it! From the moment we walked in, the girls working there were absolutely amazing – so welcoming, super helpful with the menu, and honestly the highlight of the whole experience. They made us feel so looked after and excited to come back.

The place itself is clean, fun, and chic – such a nice vibe after a long day. The panko burgers were halal (big win!) so we gave them a go, and wow… they were delicious. Now, I’m extremely picky about fries (serious fry lover here), but theirs were perfectly crunchy and full of flavour – honestly some of the best I’ve had.

A huge thank you to the lovely girls for turning our tired journey home from work into such a wonderful experience. You’ve officially got new loyal customers! Great location just off the canal route. Staff were friendly, attentive and helpful and I can't fault them.

Order needs to be placed via a tablet on your table. I'm not a big fan of this concept but went with it. I found it quite difficult to order what I had seen on the menu as the two didn't appear to match completely, but that could have been down to my use of the app. Another issue I have with the Tablet order and pay system is I have to instantly decide on my level of tip ... Before I have even seen my food or had a complete service. This seems a bit silly to me.

Food came and the fries were fabulous. I can't help but be disappointed by the chicken burger and onion rings. Burger was very small for the price and was essentially a piece of fried chicken breast, with some over chewy and crispy areas. Onion rings were hard and too crispy and some of the onion was a bit rough.

I had a coke with my meal, the choice of alcoholic drinks was very limited, I think there was only Cruz Campo available (wouldn't swear to this).

Overall for a meal which cost me £31.19 including a service charge of 12.5%, other than the excellent fries I would probably prefer a chicken burger from McDonald's or Burger King. This could be just down to personal preference, but I am giving an honest appraisal of my meal and experience here.

Again staff were 5 ⭐, but meal and overall experience disappointing. 10/10. Food was incredible. Very good quality. Best meal I’ve had in a long time. Massive shoutout to Tim the chef for accommodating for my vegan mum with the coleslaw. And BIG shoutout to Robyn for serving us. You were AMAZING. Highly highly recommend! Gourmet Burger Kitchen in Birmingham is in a great location, right by the canal, close to the Utilita Arena and even the Black Sabbath bench if that is something you want to visit.

Most of the food spots around this area seem to be chains, and I could not find any smaller independent places, which I usually prefer to support.

That said, this chain actually surprised me with the quality of the food. It was much better than I expected. The service, however, was nothing special. I was not a fan of the tablet-based ordering system, especially as we had major issues when it came to paying.

I would return to a GBK, but only if the food is consistent across other branches, as I was genuinely happy with the meal. The downside is the price. For a chain restaurant, it felt quite expensive, and to be honest, not entirely worth it. While some of the food is cooked fresh to order, it still feels quite standardised, and you do get the sense that not everything is made from scratch in the branch. The service also did not really add much to the experience.

At that price point, I would usually expect to be supporting a smaller independent burger place where more care goes into the food and where the chefs likely have a bit more skill and flexibility in how things are prepared. Fabulous staff.. the nicest people and they went above and beyond to make us comfy and look after my families needs. Food service fab and fast and tasty. We had naked bun and chicken selects .. which is perfect for a duo who like eating slightly healthier options. Only improvement would be drinks were all full of sugar … could do with some Holos Kombucha.

I've been coming to Pad Thai Karaoke Bar for over 10 years, and it's truly the best karaoke spot in town!

The music selection is massive, covering everything from UK hits to Thai, Vietnamese, and Indonesian classics. The vibe is unbeatable, the drinks are always flowing, and the service is top-notch.

⚠️ Exciting News! ⚠️
They are now open until 4 AM - giving you even more time to sing, dance, and party!
Plus, they are gearing up for a major renovation to bring an even better karaoke atmosphere for all our loyal customers. ❤️❤️❤️

If you're looking for the ultimate karaoke experience, Pad Thai is the place to be! 😉 Lovely Thai restaurant with Karaoke room. Food is delicious while eating you can enjoy singing as well. strongly recommended Thai style grill pork cheek, Thai papaya salad, wasabi king prawn, Thai pineapple fried rice, Thai mango with sticky rice. All the dish I ordered so nice. like them all. must try place. Good food and service. If you order the set menu you get the room for free for 3 hours. The Korean keyboard doesn’t work on the karaoke machines but Chinese and English work. £5 per person per hour if not getting set menu which is very reasonable. Really good value of karaoke + dinner combination, with a reasonable price and a good selection of food. The list of songs available in the karaoke system is quite updated as well. I have high expectations for Thai food and this place was recommended by Google when I came to Birmingham. The private booths are a cool touch as you can really chill out and eat in a group.

The food how ever isn't really a good rep for Thai food. Had the green curry and smokes ribs. The ribs were just deep fried with some sweet sauce ontop and the curry wasn't really ""flavoursome"".

Didn't finish the food and definitely won't be back but would like to try the karaoke 🎤 at some time",1.0,0.0,"[""Chinese"", ""korean"", ""Indian"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Thai"", ""Dessert"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['thai', 'karaoke', 'pad', 'pad thai', 'set menu', 'ribs', 'curry', 'fried', 'set', 'rice']","[""pad"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""set"", ""rice"", ""korean"", ""Dessert"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""thai"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""set menu"", ""ribs"", ""karaoke"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Thai"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""fried"", ""curry"", ""pad thai"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Indian"", ""Chinese"", ""Value"", ""Experience""]"

WORKERS CAN SEE INTO BATHROOM!! They offer you one complimentary drink (for a room with two people) in exchange for zero privacy - I booked a room with a bath for relaxation - workers on scaffolding outside could see right through the blinds! I sent them a nice message to resolve this in a nice way but got zero response unfortunately.

Can’t even use the bath which you pay extra for as workers can see you in the bath even with blinds closed as much as they close. Twin room for me and my mate. Comfy beds. No noise disturbance. Good black out blinds. Clean bathroom. Great breakfast. Flexibility for late checkout at a very reasonable price. And a big thanks to Antonia at the front desk for being so friendly when we turned up. Really made us feel welcome and happy to be there. Huge recommendation. Good breakfast and nice, clean, good size room & bathroom. Work going on outsid and I think they started early like 9, 9ish; noted the toilet flush not working properly - tho these not severely impacted my stay experience. Staff were friendly. Stayed as I was in town for a party and wanted to see the changes in the city centre. Location is great you are central and have good bars and restaurants around you.

Service I have to say was great as I had the staff up the wall I didn't like the suite I booked when I got there but the staff let me pick the suite I wanted. Which was huge two room with an amazing bathroom. Shower could easily of held 8 people lovely freestanding bath. The bed was off the scale big (way bigger than a king-size) would of said two kings pushed together but it was one bedframe one mattress (yeas, I checked).

Had breakfast both mornings with was really nice and spoilt for choice. We stayed for 1 night (last night) and this hotel is stunning! The staff are all really helpful and friendly, they are a credit to the hotel.  Rooms are beautiful and spacious and very clean, we ate in the bistro and our meal was amazing, breakfast was faultless
Will definitely be booking again very soon

Tasty Food, But Can Be Inconsistent ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Pepe’s on Coronation Street is a great spot for delicious, flavorful grilled chicken. The sauces and seasoning are always on point, and the portions are generous. The menu has a good variety, and the sides complement the meals well.

However, the chicken can sometimes be a little dry, which takes away from the otherwise great taste. When it’s cooked just right, it’s amazing, but the consistency could be improved.

Overall, still a solid choice for a tasty meal, and I’d definitely go back! Nice and clean place. Had ordered chick and rice meal with piri piri fries. Was yummy and great quality and quantity. Will recommend to others. Friendly staffs. Fast orders. Had a great day. If I could give 0 stars I would. Me and my partner had ordered 2 chicken tasca meals on Deliveroo. This is something we occasionally order and enjoy, and we called up the store to specially ask for no siraccha on them as I’m allergic and my partner doesn’t like spice. The woman on the phone didn’t seem to listen properly but I trusted it as I have never had an issue before this. The order arrives and I can already see the siraccha dripping out of both of my tascas. I called up the store to ask them to re send them out, and the same lady answered and told me ‘we will just do better next time’, yet I’ve just wasted £40 on my dinner that I now cannot eat. I got passed on to a manager who told me to get a refund through Deliveroo, and I expressed how this is a joke as I wanted my dinner and would then have to wait 3-5 days for the money to come back into my bank. Very disgusted with the customer service and the lack of care when we are going out of our way to specially ask for changes on the order, I really suggest this branch trains their staff better with how to deal with customers, as I used to work at the Sutton Coldfield branch and we would have all our front of house staff well trained with better manners. Really has put me off ordering with you guys again, nothing was done to help rectify the issue from there end and left 2 very loyal customers very unhappy. NEVER AGAIN…

I was one of the first people in this pepes when it opened. And ate there 3 times a week when i worked in that area. I have probably visted about 60 times and introduced many people to pepes.  So what happened today …  i placed an order for a quarter chicken meal - started eating there and took the rest home. Had about 3 sips of my drink.. when i got home i opened the lid of the drink to add some
Ice cubes and there it was black particles that looked like mould and dirt in my drink - 7up.

Loved the Ramadan special Thali, food was well seasoned and cooked.

Thali dishes can sometimes be hit or miss, but here, every single item was exceptional! We also tried the Himalayan Fire Ribs, and they were simply Top Notch!

A special shoutout to Jasi, Lavesh, and Asma for their outstanding service – they made our dining experience even better. The trip from Gloucester to Birmingham was absolutely worth it, and we’ll definitely be coming back again!

When I phoned them to tell them about our take away they made out it was us, rather than there slop they cooked, a few times I phoned only to have the phone put down on me, so as a whole no stars I've just eaten from here and I can safely say avoid because I've had stomach cramps and everything else that goes along with that. Pretty sure it's mild food poisoning. The rest of the food will be going in the bin. V poor, the Thai lemongrass chicken was just about acceptable however the pancakes we got with duck had mould on. I also don't know how you get salt and pepper chips wrong but they managed that too.

Inside plenty of seating available in every corner of the building. They have a high chair seating area plus big cozy lounge chairs with tables from 1 seat to 8 they have all here.

They also have a book of the month stand selling books, gives it a cozy cafe atmosphere. Staff are really friendly and nice so that's a plus, makes it appealing to visit there multiple times.

You can grab a book like i did and spend a few hours relaxing with a delicious hot chocolate enjoying your moment. Avoid this coffee shop!! Horrible experience. Ordered a latte and hot chocolate to take away. When I checked the hot chocolate it had a very weird aspect, looked like it had oil and something floating that looked very similar to RAT POISON!!!!! Unfortunately I was to far to go back to the shop. I will never go anywhere near a Coffee Nero ever again. Very scary to think that I could have been poisoned while drinking a coffee from such a popular shop that is meant to follow hygiene and safety regulations Nice and cosy cafe in a beautiful square. Good staff are good and quick service. Plenty of seating inside and outside the cafe. Quite decent atmosphere though.

The woman serving us was genuinely LOVELY. 10/10 Was suggested this place to help with my complicated grief I was told it was somewhere to go to get help and support .
My experience was horrible I felt so out of place and actually thought I was at the wrong venue . So after waiting in a queue in a busy coffe shop for over 10 minutes I finally got to the counter where I had to announce in front of everyone waiting in the queue behind me my reason for being there . Which was not ideal and I did question if I was actually at the right place . The ladies behind the counter were lovely and friendly but as I wasn’t asking for a coffee it took her two times of me explaining before she understood why I was there . I was then taken to a corridor where there was again a lovely lady who helped me but said it’s more a drop in hub for students and to maybe try a different one . I felt so uncomfortable there as I wasn’t asking for the only person there over 30 and even if I’d wanted to purchase a coffe it was out of my price range I think the cheapest one was £5.00 so who ever said students are broke haven’t been around students these days . The whole experience was uncontrollable and not to mention parking I had to park theee streets away and walk a good 10 minutes .

Well seasoned tasty food and good prices, with a selection of sauces and salads to pick from. They also have nice cakes and a wide variety of vegan ice creams (magnum).

I recently visited this Costa Coffee in Birmingham city centre while staying nearby for a meeting. It was a fantastic experience — the coffee was excellent and a perfect way to freshen up my morning. The atmosphere in the shop is warm and inviting, and I truly enjoyed my time there.

The location is right in the heart of town, surrounded by a lovely area that adds to the overall charm. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better.

If you’re in Birmingham, I highly recommend stopping by this Costa Coffee. It’s a great spot to relax, recharge, and enjoy a great cup of coffee.

Thank you to the team for such great service! Absolutely must try the seasonal maple & hazel range. I had the hot chocolate one and it was DELICIOUS!!! The staff were a bit busy talking amongst themselves and felt slightly put off but still polite and courteous. The area was amazing too and appreciated inside and outside options. Overall wonderful time had waiting for others in the SeaLife centre. Great location, good coffee, friendly and helpful staff Good location, quick service, not bad coffee and good staff. Enjoy the atmosphere more than coffee. For a small Costa the staff here were very good... Not long to wait and found a vacant table inside... 🙂

We had hot chocolates and they were fantastic.

Some other customers with a young child got up and left a right mess on their table and floor and just walked out !!  (which I find appalling, they must live in a dustbin to think that's acceptable in any Society) I tried to hint about the mess they were leaving as they were dusting broken crisps off their child into the floor and table but it just bounced off them... If it was my shop I'd have given them a broom before they left !!

The young lady who was on duty just took it in her stride to clean up after these vagrants.

After a short time I noticed this same young lady go outside where a small female child had accidentally dropped her drink and was looking quite upset...

She helped clean up the mess and then made the girl another drink...

Definitely above and beyond from this Costa team member and the drink was great too. 🙂",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['costa', 'coffee', 'mess', 'child', 'young', 'costa coffee', 'young lady', 'location', 'table', 'drink']","[""young lady"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""drink"", ""Dessert"", ""mess"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""child"", ""costa coffee"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""young"", ""table"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""costa"", ""location"", ""Value"", ""coffee"", ""Experience""]"

I absolutely love the theatrics of their cocktails – they really create a unique, hands-on drinking experience that makes it more than just a drink, it’s a whole vibe.

The food was stunning! We ordered a variety of dishes, all beautifully presented and super tasty.

A couple of things that let the night down slightly: we were seated in a more secluded area, which felt a bit disconnected from the lively atmosphere. Also, the downstairs bar – which looks amazing – wasn’t open, which was a big letdown. Service was a bit slow too; we had to flag down staff a few times.

That said, we still had a great night overall. It’s always a cool spot for a fun evening out. If you're a cocktail enthusiast, this spot is a must-visit. The cocktails are not only delicious but also presented with remarkable creativity, guaranteed to surprise and delight. The nibbles complement the drinks perfectly, making for a great culinary experience. It's an ideal venue to unwind and enjoy a great time with friends. Went to the Alchemist today with my sister and wanted to leave a review, particularly for our server Eva! She was just amazing!!!

She was super friendly and helpful (particularly as we had so many questions on recommendations etc). She was amazing!!

Food wise it was good. We tried the AFC flatbread which was really good and the fried fish dish. Though the rice was a tad watery, Eva and the manager handled that very well for my sister! Would always recommend coming here! Went there for birthday drinks with a friend. We had some amazing drinks, really separates them from other bars. Glad to have gone there.

You’d think expectations would be low – after all, it’s just chicken, right? But there are still plenty of ways it can go wrong.

Let’s start with the chicken: overall, it tasted great. I went for the super hot and it was a good balance of spice and flavour – definitely the highlight of the meal. However, the spicy rice was a big letdown. It wasn’t spicy at all, extremely sticky, and honestly gave off the impression it had been cooked days ago and reheated. It felt more like sushi rice than anything that should come with grilled chicken.

The best way to describe the whole experience is this: like your local takeaway trying to be Nando’s. Tables weren’t clean – the place was quiet with barely anyone around, and yet when I sat down, my arm landed on a sticky, dirty surface. Not the best first impression.

The one real positive was the service – friendly and helpful. And because the chicken wasn’t bad, it’s not a 1-star review. But overall, there’s a lot of room for improvement. Stopped by after seeing a local band after a recommendation from a local. Was not disappointed. Fast, friendly service from Doc and some super tasty food! Can definitely recommend the Hot quesadilla!! Would visit again! I tried the chicken rice at Pepe’s, and it was a total disappointment. It tasted like it had been sitting around for days—bland, dry, and completely unappetizing. On top of that, the service was a nightmare. The staff was unbelievably rude, making the whole experience even worse. Definitely not going back What a shameful service waited for my chicken 35 minutes ordered Mega meal! They missed my Fries!! This is not the first time this has happened last time when I ordered rice were missing!!!! Staff rather muck about this the coordination than check the order making sure they serving correct order!! Shame never again to Selly Oak!!!! I Love the Chicken served by Pepe’s , the juiciness and Tenderness of chicken is way too good. I’d recommend to try this once in your life.

We sat the far back and we could see and hear the stage clearly. We didn't have anyone sitting in the row infront of us but I can imagine that they would partially obscure the view unlike at the New Rep theatre.

Enjoyed the show, singing and dancing from an amateur production about the lifelong of Edith Piaf.

No purchase from the confectionery counter. Brilliant place when I was in primary school paganel I saw Charlie and the chocolate 🍫 factory that was brilliant lovely acted.

I've attached my bill, I'd warn you though to get the prawns and lamb chops from the mains section instead of starters/appetisers if you're a party of 3 or more, perhaps a platter. Paneer flavour was amazing, my partner and I specially loved the prawns tandoori and lamb chops. Tender and juicy, well cooked, great use of ghee, just blown away. Shami kebab was alright.

Mains were insanely good, no jokes. The madras sea bream and king prawns biryani blew us away completely. Simple flavours yet seemingly so complex. Nothing overwhelming but really was a taste to behold. Get them without thinking again.

Absolutely lovely hospitality, didn't get the names but we were very well looked after. Great staff. Will definitely come again.

Alas, all good reviews have to come to a bad end. Pina colada was a bit of a let down but not really disappointing. Its just the way I am. I'm extremely critical of my PC's. Sorry to mention but you can probably pop into L*s-Igu*nas next door for it with a 1+1 offer. Absolutely beautiful restaurant, brilliant service and outstanding customer service. Food is absolutely phenomenal, chicken is so tasty and chunky. Been here for 2 years running now when we come to the hippodrome and cant fault the restaurant. They dont have tikka mascara on the menu but still make it when I come and visit. Would highly recommend this restaurant 👌 Visited here by chance, before seeing a show at the hippodrome and it did not disappoint! The food was absolutely fantastic and the service was excellent. The waiter was able to recommend dishes, and let us add to our order later on without a fuss.

The cup I was given looked like it had been used before — the lid was loose and didn’t feel sealed properly. The coffee was cold and filled way too much, making it really hard to handle. As soon as I picked it up, it spilled all over my car and clothes. Completely ruined my morning. Not what I expect from a brand like Costa. Cakes were mediocre, coffee was nice.  Staff just did their job nothing more. Expensive £11.74. We did not know we had stayed for longer than 3 hours, as they were closing, staff could have advised us. We both got a parking ticket, which is a rip off in itself. So that adds to Costa's bottom line. Not impressed. Will not be going to this Costa again. Had an Asian lady with black hair (Sordy I don’t know their names) make my drink and she was clearly struggling as a man came in and had to tell her to do things now and get another member of staff in. A blonde lady came in and took over and made my boyfriends drink which he tried and it was nice but now he’s too scared to keep drinking incase of health implications. my coffee has a black hair stuck to the lid on the inside and I myself have blonde/ginger hair. Please see photo. Genuinely so upset with the level of care or should I say lack there of from this one staff member as it’s clear the others know what they’re doing. My drunk cost me near £4 and it’s absolutely wasted ? £9 on drinks we can’t even have ??? Furious. Wont be returning to my own local costa. Really disheartening to see the care and quality of our food services have rapidly dropped. This drive thru Costa is a great little gem of a coffee shop, it’s conveniently located at the five ways roundabout In Birmingham.

The drive through approximately 7 - 12 minutes as it is relatively small only serving 8 cars at at time. There are parking spaces with 3 hour limit I do not believe you have to pay for parking (I do advise that you check upon entry).

Inside of the café was relativity welcoming.
The staff where bustling about completing orders but no attention was given to the vacant tables that still had the residue of the last customers present and chairs that where covered in crumbs and juices.

It’s a little pricey for a herbal tea as one Jasmin’s and Green Tea Pot was £2.10 when it’s just a tea bag and hot water which is free of requested.

As you walk in you see several tables to be seated and the cold fridge for toasties and sandwiches some fresh fruit too. You can buy Costa merch as well like flasks and cups.

To the back of the cafè there is two cute meeting room type seating areas where you can really enjoy the peace and quite and maybe do some group meetings in peace with a nice coffee.

It’s convenient as it’s is on the door step of a well known hotel and the edge of five ways. Service is very friendly and approachable here. The atmosphere is calmer than most cafes and most importantly the coffee hits the spot! My go to: an iced oat latte with sugar free syrup! If you're about in the City Centre then be sure to drive thru and grab a Costa coffee!",0.6,0.4,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone""]","['costa', 'coffee', 'drive', 'hair', 'peace', 'black hair', 'blonde', 'lid', 'ways', 'parking']","[""blonde"", ""ways"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""peace"", ""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""lid"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""drive"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""hair"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""black hair"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Fast Food"", ""costa"", ""parking"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Value"", ""coffee"", ""Experience""]"

Misleading consumer
We were not aware of the charges as our booking was at 10am. When we entered the shop there was no employee to introduce the charging requirements and finally we chose to pay 30 pounds an hour. In the middle of the process, we confirmed with the staff how much is the total amount, the staff told us 205 pounds, and finally paid 235 pounds at the checkout. Resulting in us not being able to make a reasonable choice that
At that time there were two options :.
1. pay two low fees: 108 ➕168 pounds, a total of 276 pounds low fees
2. Pay an extra 30 pounds an hour.

2. The service attitude is very poor.
We asked the staff for chopsticks and they just opened the door (without even walking in) and threw the chopsticks on the table. We went there for a birthday party. There’re not many food options and the price is a ripoff!! A medium size coke is £12 pounds?! But that’s like relatively the cheapest option.
The service was good but one thing was kinda misleading was that they told us we can have the room for 3 hours and we end up paying extra £30 because nobody noticed us times up and asked us if we wanted to have more hours, we missed the timeline. We went there at around 6:45 and ended up at around 10:30, we would have said yes if they asked and it’s fine, but they just keep charging without noticing us. That part just makes me feel uncomfortable We called to check if they were open for karaoke and they said ""yes, til 4am""
We got taxis across town and were turned away at the door for no reason other than ""Chinese only"". Clearly racist, AVOID if you aren't Chinese!!! Chinese karaoke. Private rooms are booked with large parties.  Food an alcohol is serve. Nice friendly staff and it closes early hours in the morning.

It's a great place to unwind and watch the hustle and bustle of the station. Highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area! James does the best oat cappuccino in Birmingham. Always a friendly service, seems to multitask like a pro. Give the man a raise.

The cafe is nice too. Plenty of seating out back. I had a disappointing experience with a very rude staff member while ordering a takeaway drink from here. I was met with unexpected hostility for simply placing an order separately to my partner who ordered before me (even though I’d already stated I was paying separately), as if I had somehow disrupted their ability to prepare two drinks at once.

I was genuinely confused, and when I questioned the reaction the staff member became argumentative rather than helpful. Based on this interaction, I wouldn’t recommend coming here. I find their insistence over closing their outdoor seating area 30 mins before closing very annoying. They only have a handful of tables and chairs to put away - a five minute job- but ive even witnessed staff moving on customers that are already sat down and haven’t finished their drinks. Very unnecessary and unwelcoming service especially if you want to enjoy good weather, smoke or vape.

We started with an amazing mixed grill, packed with tender, flavorful meats, perfectly spiced and cooked to perfection, the fish being my personal favourite part. It was the ideal way to kick off the meal. For my main, I had a Kashmiri pizza with chips, which was a unique and delicious choice.

Having being on crutches, the staff were amazing. Providing seats with plenty of space and alot of space to manouvre with easy access to the toilet

The service was excellent, and the food was unforgettable. Royal Watan truly made my birthday special, and I’ll definitely be back! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality food and a great dining experience. Came with a friend for a work event and travelled 30 minutes and was really worth it

Poppadoms, mango chutney is great

We had chicken Karahi with naans and good portion sizes

Don’t forget to have their mocktails as they tasted amazing

Not only that staff was really friendly and attentive

Price wise very reasonable and affordable

For two people cost no more than £35 for what we ordered.

Atmosphere is great with great music in the background

Lastly when do you use warm hand wipe with a gentle scent of oud. We came in after reading the great reviews. They are all spot on.
I had a mutton shashlick hanging kebab starter which was lovely. We had a butter chicken chooza which had a decent kick to it. We also had a keema muttar which was excellent. 5 of us ate here and we all thought the curries were full of flavour made with lots of fresh ingredients.
All the staff were very friendly. Bring your own alcohol. My daughters enjoyed their mocktails too.
Don't hesitate to eat here! Thanks so much to Kiki and Usman for serving me and my friends today x
I had the lamb chops - seasoned so nice and the masala chips
They gave me a free mocktail both are so good: sunrise and strawberry daq xx

We had a really enjoyable time at Lost and Found. Despite not having a reservation, we were seated promptly (though it was a weekday), which was a great start. The interior is beautifully done—stylish and welcoming.

The staff were friendly and attentive throughout our visit. We appreciated the online ordering system, which made things very convenient. The menu had a good range of options, and I went with the fish and chips—absolutely delicious! We also took advantage of the 2-for-1 offer on selected drinks, which was a nice bonus.

Overall, a great experience, and we’ll definitely be back. Recently visited this pub, prior to a theatre show. Booking is definitely advised with this venue. It was very busy when we arrived and extremely hot inside. It was very noisy, with lots or party groups and hen party, too. The staff were very welcoming, helpful and friendly. We were shown to a table and then asked to move to the one alongside, some 20 minutes later! Our food order arrived within 15 minutes. It was well cooked and presented, tasted delicious, too. Our server was lovely and nothing was too much trouble for her. The building itself was a bank, so the inside was beautiful, as you would expect from an old building. However, the leaves which hand around as decoration were very dusty and definitely due to be replaced/cleaned. Also, the downstairs corridors leading to the wash rooms require attention, along with the toilets themselves. On the whole, yes I would return, staff are wonderful, decoration/toilets in need of help. Staff were lovely and accommodating from start to finish. Very helpful and friendly, the place itself was really nice. Loved the decor, the facilities were lovely. Can’t really fault anything. The only thing I would say was the private bar wasn’t in use not sure if this was due to staffing as it was a Sunday but we had to go out the private room to the main bar for drinks and we had to order pretty much soon as we arrived as the kitchen closed at 8 and my booking was at 6. Apart from that our waitress Lolita? Was AMAZING! Met with a friend for a late lunch, catch up, natter. Perfect! We ordered 4 starters and shared as neither of us were over hungry. Food delicious! Surrounding just lovely! We then sat there chatting so long we realised the 2 for 1 cocktails had started! Not many to choose from but my! They were so good! I know we'll be back again! Had a fantastic bottomless brunch with a friend who l hadn't seen for a long while here. It was the perfect setting and the drinks just kept coming! The food was delicious and the cocktails were refreshing. I will definitely be back for another visit, it was so worth every penny and I even brought a dessert after our bottomless brunch time was up !!

Really unique decor and cozy atmosphere, staff were friendly and attentive.

Food was nice and the menu had plenty of good options. We booked using FirstTable for 50% off food, so we got very reasonable prices as well. We didn't get any drinks, but there was a wide variety at the bar.

Overall, highly recommended! Been here before years ago on a friday night when it was lively and heaving. This time I visited during a quiet daytime.

It's a striking place to be in terms of decor. They serve some fantastic beers on tap, and are also good for a coffee. They made my wife a lovely cappuccino.

The service was superb and friendly. I know the place must be good when my wife talks about going back there again. It's a shame we had elsewhere to be, as we could've happily spent a couple of hours here. I always visit this bar when I'm in Birmingham,it's really beautiful inside,tucked away underground by the Burlington hotel.
Nice friendly staff,drink price's are high,but it is a big city.I'll order some food next time,as they looked like they had a lot of nice things on the menu. Love this place! Full of atmosphere and theatre, top range of drinks and service stop on.

I reserved through Booking.com and received a free breakfast bundle (I believe this perk is available for Genius Level 1 or 2 members). I was also kindly upgraded to a better room upon arrival—thank you to the receptionist for that!

The hotel and the room both have a charming traditional vibe and architecture, which I found beautiful and unique.
I tried the porridge from the breakfast buffet, and it was quite good. I also had a hamburger at the hotel's restaurant, and that was a great experience as well. This is a lovely place to stay in a great location. The hotel itself is decorated in what I would describe as ""old money"" style - nice and clean and in places expensive looking but in other ways it can seem dated, but that's just a matter of opinion. Never the less, I cannot fault it. The staff were lovely and the room was immaculately clean. Our bed was very comfortable. Loads of wardrobe space. The bathroom was massive.
There's a bar inside the hotel but there's also Bacchus Bar downstairs - not part of the hotel but just in the floor below. Really interesting, different bar.
Parking was easy, we used the car park above Grand Central so it's literally a 2 minute walk through the station and across the road.
We weren't woken up during the night by other guests, which is always a bonus!
You won't need transport staying here. Everything is within walking distance. Great location right opposite main station. Traditional hotel, large room and shower so so powerful! You could tell it caused problems as small damage to floors but bathroom was ok, not the most modern but clean. Luxury bedding & pillows were lovely for a great nights sleep.
The staff on reception were very friendly, for breakfast not as. We waited a couple of minutes to be seated and four staff walked past us. They were busy but thought they could have said Good Morning and smiled to us but we were just ignored.- not great hospitality.
Breakfast was included, if you had a full English but some of the others items had a supplement (see photo)  which I thought was strange as products no more expensive. Maybe, they charged this so kitchen could concentrate on just a couple of items on the menu.
During the day, bar service was friendly and efficient.
Stayed just for one night and so very worth it for location. Great location for central Birmingham. The hotel is extremely clean and very well presented. The staff are friendly and go  beyond to make your stay that bit special. The food is delicious and again well presented  in a bright,  fresh clean restaurant. If you need a great hotel with quality in central Birmingham, then this venue is for you. Staff were excellent, dining service was excellent. The breakfast was great.
Rooms were clean. The Decor was old school with Shinning vibs which is a positive thing for me. The room had no working AC which made the room very stuffy, thankfully they did supply a fan. And the view from my 333 room was original. The Hotel is in the Centre of the city so it's perfect for a city visit

Placed my order, asking if they had skimmed milk, and was told only semi-skimmed. OK, that was fine.  The server went on to make my drink, making a big show of going into the fridge for said semi-milk.   It was obvious they had none.  She then proceeded to use the full-fat milk on the side.   I pulled her up on this, she totally denied it, although I had seen it with my own eyes.    She then admitted it, telling me she had too much on her mind etc.   She did remake the drink using oat milk, promptly spilling it on the counter and on me.   This was no biggie, I guess, well, not for me,  I just prefer skimmed milk, but as I pointed out to the server, what if this had been a medical dietary need ?? An allergy situation, and she was substituting items, which could have been a dangerous situation.    She couldn't seem to grasp that people could have issues with items being substituted without them knowing what they were getting. I know this sounds petty over milk, but if you're serving food, drinks, etc, if the customer asks for a certain thing, don't lie. Allow the customer to change the order, don't substitute. It’s raining and all I need a nice coffee because of cold weather. It makes you feel so good. Strong, full of taste and well roasted. Great service by friendly staff. There were more healthy choice of breakfast but I need just coffee.
It’s small but still indoor and outdoor seating. I like the location just inside Moor train station which is a beautiful station as well like old Victorian style.

It is the only cafe at the Birmingham Moor Street train station.

I had sausage bap and matcha latte.

Definitely recommended.

Good place for getting some snacks and refreshments whilst awaiting train arrival. It is a coffee shop with a historical look that takes you to way back of the clock. It may have limited space inside but every corner of it worthy of your time. Both inside and outside has a balanced environment. There were enough comfortable sitting spaces in both areas. The decor of the shop made it an interesting place to visit. The stuffs were helpful, kind and welcoming. There were a manageable queue. There is a lot of interesting option for snaks. Had one latte and croissant and I loved it. The small glass of champagne happen to be very popular here among others, must be a good experience to enjoy while waiting for your train in lazy evening. Enjoy 😊 Lovely food and a good selection of drinks available. Staff very kind and nice seating in the concourse of the station. Ideal little stop when waiting for a train Art deco ‘old world’ train station cafe with lovely staff. Think Peaky Blinders meets Brief Encounter. Great coffee and tea but the sausage sandwich was less successful, suffering probably from being ‘kept warm’ too long the brioche (why? Excess calories and sweetness not required!) bun tasted a bit pappy and spoilt the sausage. I ordered a kinder Bueno frappe and was served by Soham, and I gotta tell you.

It is unusual for me to forget a place, and that I couldn't see my review.
I guess it is my age.
Anyway it was some rather nice adverts on FB that made me want to visit last Saturday night. However I did notice that it had received mixed reviews but these never put me off a place. Most reviews don't tell you a fat lot anyway.
Parking isn't great in Harborne but we struck lucky with a space on a nearby side street. It's situated on the first floor, up a long flight and I didn't notice any provision for those with mobility issues.
Once inside it has a very nice feel, although the trip to the loo let's the side down. The wife wasn't a big fan of the unisex cubicles.
It's licenced and the bar is well stocked however you can take your own alcohol but they will add a corkage fee which I think is a £1 per person.
It was quite busy and the atmosphere was very pleasant, relaxed and somewhat respectful which makes a change. The service was pleasant, quite a few staff but some were more engaging than others.
The food was excellent, and I couldn't find fault. I noticed some reviews mentioned bland but our starter and both mains were just the opposite.
The shared sheekh kebab was very nice, it could have done with a few more seconds in the microwave but it was very tasty and quite large.
The chicken Chetinad and a chicken curry were hard to tell apart until you tasted them. The Chetinad although a 'thinner' curry than I would prefer had layered spicing more typical of Indian style cooking than Bangladeshi.
The sides were excellent, especially the naan. None of that tricolour pilau rice either. The chips were good, could be better but I would say that for all but one 'Indian' restaurant in the Midlands.
I thought the bill was surprisingly good taking everything into consideration and I would be more than happy to go back. First time we tried it.  food was not to the quality.  very bland. This place now deserves one-star rating; the food was nice once; I'm not sure if the chef has changed. I gave them five stars two years ago. Now the food tastes bland and the taste is like a cheap take away. The food is top notch, service is friendly and attentive. The lamb balti has plenty of nice big chunks of tender lamb.

The price is a bargain, that amount of food for 11 pounds. The service is terrific, the owners, besides being extremely busy, are super friendly Has great food and a huge variety. Even though it’s a fish and chips shop, his chicken and meat options are extremely tasty 👅. Great service by the employees and the owner said it’s halal and gave us extra food. Portions are more than enough per person, almost unable to finish it with how filling the food is. Have went to the place multiple times and it never gets old. BEST CHIPPY in the world? Could well be!
I absolutely love the chips here at Gabriels. Why? Well it starts with the easy parking despite being at the top of the busy Harborne High Street. With some spaces on the road and additional spaces on the car park (just remember to enter your car reg on the tablet on the counter in the shop!).
Then the actual shop is very smartly presented and clean. You can even see the food being prepared and your order being made out.
The staff are so nice and polite that you feel you stepped in your own kitchen. And they dress clean and tidy which is so important for me.
But the food is where it is actually at. The chips are without doubt the best I have ever had and I have eaten all over the world. They are the best potatoes for sure and they are cooked to perfection. Neither undercooked nor overly heated. And they are always fresh. Never reheated either.
I just couldn't resist in putting my box of chips on the ground outside the shop to capture a photo of the delicious chips today. YUMMY YUMMY, HAPPY TUMMY :) This is the best chippy in Harborne, as far as I know it's the best in Birmingham. Good value, fish battered excellent, superb chips too. Kebabs offered are also nice and the pizzas are good too. Honestly it's hard to choose what to order, they have good options. I think the cods scallops wish they were Gabriel's, or should do. Great business providing generous portions of chips I think.

Oh and the tartare sauce and lemon with the fish is excellent Greatest chip shop of all time!

Been coming here for about 6 months now and genuinely wouldn’t be able to go anywhere else.

A quaint and cute space with interesting artwork on the walls (my fave is the Sunflower painting that caught my eye, simple and stunning!) .. really fresh and affordable food including coffee! Made my experience very comforting.. I had a Chicken Zinger Hot Melt in Ciabatta and an Oatuccino! Very yumm! Oh and the service was very good as well. Very approachable lady at the till.. This place is nice inside and they have a great selection of salads. I wanted a piece of chicken schnitzel and I asked if the chicken was British. The lady serving looked surprised as obviously no one has asked this before. At first she said it was British chicken but somehow I wasn’t convinced so I asked her to check.She then came back and said the chicken was from Thailand. Very disappointing that this establishment is not using British meat and also disappointing that she was willing to fob it off as British chicken. The manager was friendly and the coffee and fresh orange juice was nice. The fish finger sandwiches were really disappointing - more like fish cake fingers dripping with tartare sauce. A messy eat and not very pleasant. I visited on 25th July early morning
Upon arrival the initial lady who we spoke to was very warming but how the Deli was presented or priced wasn’t very clear and display was very distracting and needs to be simplified especially for new customers
We were then served by another blonde haired lady that appeared impatient though how Deli was presented was not clear left us indecisive .
It looked clean and pleasant but the complications of presentation ,the impatient and dare I say unfriendly approach the blonde lady serving,I doubt we will visit again.
Customer service is so important as I consider myself a conscious customer and I am particular about where I spend my money . It’s very unfortunate because I’m all for small businesses as I am a small business myself. The cafe next door to you sell more or less the same yet they had more customers yet I'm not really sure what people in see in this café because for us it was a disappointment.
We visited on a Saturday afternoon right after Christmas. We ordered a cappuccino, a latte and a sausage roll each because there were hardly any cakes left.
The coffees were very disappointing.
My latte was very small, and also was quite tasteless with the cappuccino not being much better.
We ask for the coffees to be extra hot and they were served more like lukewarm.
The sausage rolls were also very disappointing
with rubbery pastry, and the sausage meat was very greasy and chewy.
I also find that the staff had an couldn't care less attitude. It's a shame it's not possible to give a 0 star review, because I would.

The food was amazing and the portions were big as well. The server was super kind and patient because we were so indecisive 😢. Spent just under £25 each for a group of five. Tots amazing place for a quick brunch Amazing Food!! So well done!! The drinks are really interesting and a great range!!! Gabbi was absolutely amazing!! So warm so personable and we really appreciated her! The food was unreal! I would DEFINITELY come back!!! Great for a girls brunch or birthday!!! Brilliant spot! An brilliant place to move on from! We came here for brunch before the gig and wow what a great soothing place. Lovely airy atmosphere with a great menu.

We both went for a fresh juice mine was the energise one with kiwi , apple and spinach,  and a matcha latte.

For food we both chose the French toast with ice cream and berry compote.

When everything arrived it tasted fresh and perfect. We spied other plates going out and they too looked flawless. If I had the room I would have also ordered one of their stunning cinnamon buns too.

Overall highly recommended this place for breakfast/brunch . I visited Lovelife for brunch on Saturday and absolute loved it from the second I walked in! The internet first of all is super pretty and refreshing, I especially loved the bow details on the chairs and even took pictures!!

For the food I ordered the salt beef cubano, which was really delicious but I did wish it could have a little more sauce (a personal preference!). My friends also really enjoyed their dishes, like the full breakfast and the avocado toast. Everyone serving us was super friendly and welcoming, like the lady who took our order and told us we could ask for drinks not on the menu and Fatima who served us our food and told us how it was all freshly made that morning!

Will definitely be back for more!! Thank you for a lovely meal and ice cream! I recently went for Brunch with my friends at this cafe and the service… 10s across the board!! We were late for our reservation by around 10 minutes but there was no fuss when we walked in we were taken straight to our table. We already had a look at the menu online before so we knew what we wanted so we ordered (kitchen for brunch was closing at 2:45) and everything came out soo quick!!

Now where the service really excelled was in the staff. I didn’t get the name of the really lovely girl taking our order but if you suggested the whole ice cream, olive oil and sea salt combination (I haven’t tried it yet but I will!!) just know you really went above and beyond for us that day and we all really appreciated it. The bartender even made me a custom ice tea (which I definitely think should be a menu item because it was DELICIOUS). Another staff member called Fatima also told us that all dishes are freshly made each day like the focaccia bread we were having, and all the dishes are halal too!

The vibes were truly immaculate at this place, such cute interior design it was perfect for a hot summers day. They were also selling (quite big) ice cream cones for only £1.50 with your choice of sauce and toppings?? I mean if you haven’t been sold on the food and staff already at least come for the ice cream.

All in all, I definitely recommend this place for a brunch with anyone. But also I’m planning to go for tapas and sunday roast  too as recommended by Fatima because this place can do no wrong in my eyes, it deserves its flowers and I’m regretful to not have tried this place out sooner.

Food was nice and cocktails great! Friendly service. We shared the platter, goat curry (really good!), chicken in brown sauce (okay). Our gripe was the trio of patties.

The food and service are very good here, I've never been overly indulgent when it comes to Italian cuisine but when eating here me and my cousin always overorder but finish the lot, each time we come our bill is always over £140 as we do like to try a bit of everything.
No regrets BTW.

The pasta dishes are perfectly flavoured and if you have any meat dishes, they are top-notch with very little to critique from a negative POV.

The restaurant's decor is lovely, you easily feel at home here with it being decorated sympathetically.

The only negative I had was this visit we were seated upstairs, it was lovely up there but very quiet. When we got seated it was only us on the whole floor and (at a guess) with seating for probably at least 60 diners.
It did have a few tables through the night but was very quiet up there which is not what we're used to.
But hey, I'm seriously picking minor details up here.

Overall a solid night out at this place with a cracking environment, staff and most importantly food 👌

Thanks again and see you in December An excellent classic Italian restaurant in luxurious surroundings, tucked away by St Paul's Square. I have dined here for over a decade, and it still remains one of the best Italians in Birmingham, and rarely has it faltered. The food is superb and the choice of wines is very reasonable. I opted for a linguine monkfish and prawn dish - incredible flavours. I've been coming here for over 20 years, my favourite Italian restaurant.  Food always tastes great and homely. Service is exceptional, and prices aren't excessive.  Love the seafood options A cosy Italian spot with friendly service and a welcoming atmosphere. classic dishes done well, with a few standouts. The tiramisu was a highlight: light, creamy, and full of flavour. There’s a good range of options on the menu to suit most tastes, from pasta to pizza and more. Service was attentive without being intrusive, and the staff made us feel very welcome. A solid choice for a casual Italian meal. Would return for the tiramisu alone! Update: went again after a year. Maybe we were unlucky but food was tasteless and service was nice but not as good as before.

However even if you just pet a few particular cats, they scratch you or attempt to do so... perhaps an age restriction might be good, because we noticed multiple children who made the kitties look quite frightened. Besides that the food tastes amazing and the staff are very accommodating (thanks)! There are SO many brilliant choices on the menu, it was difficult to decide🐱 To be honest, since I moved to the UK last September, I’ve hardly had the chance to see any cats at all. I’m a proper cat lover, and up in Leeds where I live, it’s really rare to come across one, let alone get to play with them. So visiting Kitty Café in Birmingham was honestly like a dream come true.
I loved every moment of it – being surrounded by such cute, friendly kittens brought back all those memories of playing with them back home. The cats here are absolutely adorable, and the staff are just as lovely too. Guess it’s true what they say: people who love cats tend to be really nice/adorable, haha.
And at just £8, it’s an absolute bargain for such a lovely experience. Definitely worth every penny. Next time I’m in Birmingham, I’ll be sure to pop in again for another cuddle. I really do love cats so much! 🐾 I took my niece for her birthday and we had a lovely time. The staff explained everything really well. We had some food and cocktails while we sat in the cafe too. We saw lots of different cats; some were more friendly than others. The kittens were very playful! Visited the Kitty Cafe today, great little spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat whilst in Birmingham. There were over 20 cats to interact with, The team were very focused on animal welfare with a set of rules in place to make sure the cats are kept safe and happy. The decor was pretty cool too & the cats had a lot of space to move around. Cats!  Yay!  And right by New Street station. Lovely.  Obviously the cats are the stars and it’s great to see them and interact.  We also took part in their lunch time feed which was joyous. Staff are also lovely and friendly.

We all got to make delicious cocktails and pizzas and walked away with the knowledge to make both better in future 😋 If you're thinking about a gift, giving knowledge of culinary life skills is about as good as it gets 💯 What a beautiful pizzeria! Visited Smoke + Ash for a birthday meal. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived, generally the feeling inside is relaxed and friendly. Kids meal-deal margherita pizza was a big hit (a generous size to feed hungry children). Adults went for the deli charcuterie board, Bresaola cured beef pizza and the daily special pizza (asparagus and ham from memory). Food was fantastic. Drinks were great. Followed it all up with kid's ice creams, stole a spoon of my wife's chocolate + pear tart, which was delicious. Can't comment on my own dessert (panna cotta) as kids asked to try and then ate it all. Guess it's a good reason to return. I highly recommend Smoke + Ash. As pizza lovers we have been to lots of pizza places, but since discovering Smoke & Ash we don't go anywhere else. They have always been so warm and welcoming, especially with kids, and of course the pizza (gorgonzola and pear all time fave) and cocktails (chilli and yuzu margaritas please) are stunning.

The above led us to approach them to ask if they would host a small wedding reception for us and our nearest and dearest (around 30 people) which Clare and Paul accepted enthusiastically. They were so easy to work with especially in the run up to our big day, nothing was too much trouble and they absorbed much of the stress that comes with planning any event let alone your own wedding.

When it came to the day, the room was decorated beautifully (by Sophie I believe) and everything from the food to the service was flawless. The staff were so genuinely kind, relaxed and accomodating which created a lovely atmosphere for our celebration. We even arrived a little earlier than planned and this was no trouble at all. All of our guests (including vegans and other dietary requirements) were catered for perfectly and have all vowed to visit again.

Clare & Paul were also kind enough to also let us use an extra (also spacious) side room for the kids and even brought out toys etc for them to play with. This was something which meant we could really enjoy ourselves without having to occupy our very busy 2 year old!

We have never experienced such good hospitality and would highly recommend not only eating at Smoke & Ash once a week for the rest of your life, but also booking them for any similar gathering you might be planning. Thank you everyone for a perfect day.

A restaurant with a really nice atmosphere and vibe. Service was very friendly from Megan. All the dishes was nice, with a few standouts, such as the crispy aubergine and the mushroom croquettes. Plenty of options for vegan/ vegetarian diets. We came here for dinner not realising it was part of a building with a different name but it's in the corner anyway.

The service was lovely and attentive from beginning to end with some nice food choices at reasonable prices and good portions.

We chose beef cheeks, chicken supreme,  prawns , goats cheese salad, mussel croquettes,  garlic flatbread, potato bravas,  scallops,  meatballs I think that's it lol the weaker dish was unfortunately the prawns as didn't pack a lot of flavour or mussel croquettes time you scraped the contents out the shell there was not much.  The cheeks and chicken were the highlight

We did share a sangria but the flavours leaned more on the mulled wine side for me.

Overall it was a nice ambience would return. Great food, even better service! Speedy to get our order out but not in a way that felt rushed at all - was clear it was coming out from the kitchen as it was cooked, which is ideal! Everyone on shift was very attentive and polite and in a great mood contributing to a really pleasant atmosphere - even for a very busy (and hot) Saturday night. Everything was delicious! I especially recommend the seafood paella and the scallops, both were absolutely amazing! Visited on 16.02.25. The tapas we ordered came quickly and were very good quality.

The atmosphere was warm and welcoming — a great place to relax with friends or unwind after work. The staff were friendly, attentive, and genuinely made you feel at home. Service was quick, even though the pub was busy, and everyone had a smile.

The drinks selection was excellent, with a good variety of beers and spirits at reasonable prices. I also tried the food — classic pub grub, cooked well and served hot. The portion sizes were generous, and everything tasted fresh.

There’s a nice mix of people too, which gives the place a great community vibe. Whether you're just popping in for a quick pint or planning a longer evening, The Windsor delivers. I’ll definitely be coming back! Dropped into The Windsor while in the city and was really impressed. It’s got that classic pub feel — cosy, clean, and with a lively but relaxed atmosphere. You can tell it’s well looked after.

The team behind the bar were brilliant — really friendly and on the ball. I didn’t have to wait long to get served, and they were happy to recommend a few local ales I hadn’t tried before. Great selection of drinks overall.

I grabbed something to eat too, and the food hit the spot — proper pub classics, well cooked and tasty. The prices were decent as well, especially for central Birmingham.

All in all, a cracking place for a pint and a bite to eat. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area. Great local pub with a warm, welcoming vibe. The decor is traditional, featuring a beautiful old wooden bar that adds real character. There's  darts and a pool table that make it perfect for groups. The food menu offers a good selection, including pizzas, burgers, and wraps. Staff are friendly and provide excellent service. A fantastic spot for a casual night out with friends."" First time here and I will definitely come again. Friendly staff, great atmosphere and the food was very tasty. I had the Hot Chick Stack burger, the portion was big and really good value for money overall. The pepperoni pizza was good too.

Ordered one cheese board and one Meat board for about 19-20£ each expecting that would fill us up. Previously have gone places and got a decent amount of food. when complaining about the amount of food given they told us it was all locally sourced. However, if this is true we would personally want to be educated on where it is sourced and be educated on this, as when going cheddar that was what happened. However, the cheese and meat seemed to be poor quality as seen in picture and was thinly sliced which does not seem to be high quality, seemed more like a processed meat selection. It also did not state this anywhere on menus or walls ect. When we complained they also pushed back saying they understand we are students but we looked at the menu beforehand and was looking at spending about £20 each as was my birthday meal, and that was not the point of why we were upset with our food. Left feeling very underwhelmed and disappointed. Seems a steep price for what you get as no information shared, the board didn’t seem a really quality and you got about 10 slices of meat for £20. It also stated it came with crackers but i can’t see any on this picture. service was good as told us nice wines and made recommendations however when we complained they did nothing about the situation and pushed back with reasons we were not informed on We recently visited Tapas Deli and had an incredible experience that we just have to share! Silvia and her team at Tapas Deli truly go above and beyond to provide excellent service and top-notch quality drinks and food. From the moment we walked in, we was greeted with a warm welcome and felt like a valued guest throughout my visit.

The venue itself is incredibly classy, with a charming ambiance that makes you feel like you've stepped into a hidden gem. The attention to detail in the decor and layout adds to the overall dining experience, making it a perfect spot for a classy meal or a relaxing drink with friends.

The selection of tapas and beverages at Tapas Deli is perfect, each dish has authentic flavors and made with high-quality ingredients. Whether you're a foodie looking to explore new flavors or simply craving a tasty meal, Tapas Deli has something for everyone.

Overall, I can't recommend Tapas Deli enough. Silvia and her team have created a wonderful dining experience that combines excellent service, high-quality food and drinks, and a classy atmosphere. If you're looking for an authentic deli experience, look no further than Tapas Deli. It's a true gem in the dining scene! AÇAI BOWLS amazing! Had a matcha and acai bowl. Customer service was top. Loved it. So fresh! Very pleasant experience, good price for what you get; for drinks or for food - have been in both atmospheres, amazing small plates, both nice with a glass of plonk or coffee. Attentive staff & extremely friendly! Will be back again :) This place is amazing! Me and my boyfriend went for a meal out and everything was just perfect.

After completing my purchase, the staff member an older white lady who processed my payment did not provide me with a carry bag for my items. I was not asked whether I needed a bag, nor was I informed of any policy changes regarding bags. As a result I was left to manage my purchases without assistance which caused inconvenience.
I expect a basic level of customer care at Holland & Barrett including clear communication about bag policies or offering assistance with packaging. This experience fell short of the standard I associate with your brand. always take a receipt because they can't look back in their system to see your purchase. I asked for a different flavor of creatine and the store associate brought out a different product which I didn't notice until I was about to use it at home. now I'm stuck with it.

Visited Lane 7 Birmingham on a Saturday and, while the place is fun and staff are great, the queue to register for each game was frustrating and time-consuming — especially for those with bookings. I understand they mention “subject to availability” on their website, but a better system is definitely needed to manage weekend crowds.

Also worth noting: under-18s aren’t allowed after 7pm, which feels a bit early for a weekend during school holidays. That said, customer service was excellent — staff listened to our concerns and kindly let us stay until 9pm, which we really appreciated.

Overall, a good experience, but some weekend logistics could be improved. We booked the all in package for a group expecting a fun day out, but it was nothing like what was advertised. There was a promo video showing mini golf at the venue, but when we arrived, we were told that wasn’t actually available and the video was just a generic one.

After speaking with staff, we were assured we’d get a refund if we contacted the bookings team, so we left without doing any activities. But when we called, the person who answered was incredibly rude—completely unhelpful and dismissive. They said our refund would probably be denied, despite us being told otherwise and not using any of their services.

Lost £220. Won’t be coming here again ! Absolutely amazing!

Went for the all in package and it was worth it. Played a variety of games, the whole group thoroughly enjoyed. We'll definitely be back.

Worth 5 stars  but unfortunately lift was out of order and the heat was ridiculous, definitely need to get the AC on in there. Not so great to be honest starting with the arcade very overpriced not many games for example £2.50 for connect 4 I didn't even know so I stupidly just played against a robot who the hell would want to do that overpriced.. like 5 pound to play connect 4 with someone is INSANE dont drop money on most of those games.. pls

Then regarding drinks like £4.35 for coke pint etc and not fastest service. No order for how to get to next game jus waited in que even after booked time but thats fine since it wasn't so busy.. prob for a reason hm

The games.. gunshow was so BAD i actually thought we'd be shooting a real kind of gun but it was on a screen that was the worst thing ever.. not good at all, others next to us seemed to be playing a different game aswelltoo, weird.

Shuffleboard was okay first time doing took some time but was just okay.. but YEAH I  DON'T recommend coming here tbf. 😶!! I've been coming to this Lane7 regularly to play on the dance machine - Pump It Up: Phoenix - on my own and with the rest of the Pump It Up community.
Initially, we weren't too happy with the machine as the pads were under-sensitive and it was offline. However, after speaking with the general manager Ryan and the technician Damien, they were very happy to address our issues! They have been nothing but helpful and accommodating to us and that is a rare occurrence these days. Now the pads are great and the machine is online.

It was impressive to see the speed and accuracy of the photos taken also - many members of the team got a perfect photo within just a few shots. And best of all, the photos required virtually no editing. I would not hesitate in recommending River Studio to anyone, and we'll certainly be working with Richard again!

From the moment you step inside Cucina Rústica, you're enveloped in an atmosphere that feels like a warm embrace. The rustic decor, with its exposed brick and soft lighting, creates an inviting space perfect for any occasion. But the ambiance is just the beginning; the real magic happens when the food arrives.

Each dish is a masterpiece, crafted with fresh, locally sourced ingredients that burst with flavor. The pasta is homemade, the sauces are rich and complex, and the meats are cooked to absolute perfection. It's clear that the chefs pour their heart and soul into every plate, creating an unforgettable dining experience.

Beyond the exceptional food, the service is impeccable. The staff is attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about ensuring every guest feels welcomed and cared for. Whether you're a regular or a first-time visitor, Cucina Rústica makes you feel like part of their family. This restaurant isn't just a place to eat; it's a destination that nourishes the body and soul. Delicious food! They have a large selection of dishes and drinks. The staff is nice. The place can get a bit loud and it gets quite hot if you are seating inside.
Definitely recommend but you may want to sit on their terrace during the summer First time dining at an Italian restaurant and it was amazing! It’s a great spot for date nights or catching up with friends.

Very well priced and tasty. After we arrived at the restaurant, there was no one at the reception, we looked at the menu by ourselves, and when we wanted to order their signature buns, they told me that they were no longer making them. We changed to fried noodles and some stir-fried vegetables, and then we waited for a full hour before seeing our food. During this period, some guests and deliverymen came, but no one greeted them. Many guests left after waiting for 4-5 minutes.

I dropped in a bit after 9pm — the place was still busy with a steady flow of online orders. I noticed a large pot of lamb curry sitting on the counter and asked about it. A staff member said it had been freshly made about 30 minutes earlier.

I ordered it with rice — served on a single plate with a small side of salad and a bit of yoghurt sauce. No drink included. Total cost: £10.

The curry was tasty, but that’s about it. It was just lamb pieces on the bone in sauce — no vegetables, no extras. Most of the pieces were either bone or full of cartilage, with very little actual meat. For £10, especially in a student-heavy area, the portion and quality just didn’t feel worth it.

I left still hungry and ended up going to Dixie’s for a burger straight after. Disappointing overall. A*mazing! I thought Tim Hortons was the best, BUT this place trumps it all 👌 Very friendly staff blended with British fusion HALAL breakfast at its very best - just doesn’t get any better.

Some of the food is pretty good and some of the food I have tried lacks a bit of flavour/seasoning and personally I feel the  prices are slightly on the higher end for what is offered.Service is friendly. I would still recommend the place for brunch/lunch as options are quite limited in the area. Love this place. We don't get there as much as I'd like. Food is fantastic, and great choices for everyone, including us vegetarians, coffee is divine. Would reccomend Kafenion to anyone and everyone. Prices are very good too. Stopped by for an iced chai latte (which was delicious). The garden out back was such a lovely surprise with the sun shining, magnolia in bloom and a view of Cadbury. Inside was pretty busy and a little chaotic while I waited for my drink, I wasn’t totally sure where to stand or if I could wait outside. But hey, being busy is never a bad thing for a small business! All in all, a great spot in a great area! Lovely breakfast.  It was very busy today so we waited a bit longer but the service was excellent so we didn't mind waiting. We popped in for brunch last Sunday - the food was fab when it EVENTUALLY came but the service was awful.
We ordered two of the grills and two hot drinks. Our drinks came pretty sharpish but after 25 minutes we started to wonder where the food was. The couple on the table next to us had theirs and they arrived a good 10 mins after us. We flagged down a waitress who never apologized for the wait but chased up our food - ""it's being plated up now""....20 minutes later we still didn't have our food. We flagged someone else down who immediately just said ""well it's busy isn't it"", not busy enough to stand and gossip round the coffee machine. We mentioned our drinks were long gone at this point and we were just getting annoyed. A further 10 minutes later and our food finally arrived, (55 minutes after we ordered), the lady didn't even speak to us. No apologies, no 'do you need anything else', 'any more drinks'. Nothing. Noone checked back on us and when we left, no one would make eye contact.
The food was absolutely delightful - it's just a shame I won't be back due to inpolite and rude staff members.

Service was good as they tried to help us as much as they could. They just NEED air conditioning as well as already having heating. Also a RANDOM fire alarm woke me and my girlfriend up at 6am and disrupted sleep AGAIN! Not impressed. Booked a disability room. It was huge, wheelchair moved freely.  Wet room was a dream, shower seat, hand rails, raised toilet. Had the best time and the bed was nice and big and so comfortable.  Definitely booking with them again. I recently stayed at the Premier Inn in Birmingham and overall had a very positive experience. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly throughout our stay, particularly the restaurant team — their level of service was second to none and they really went out of their way to assist.

The room was comfortable and the location is ideal — just a 15-minute walk to New Street Station and the Bullring, with the Mailbox and central Birmingham attractions only a few minutes away on foot. The hotel itself is well maintained and clean, making for a pleasant base during our visit.

The only downside, and the reason for not giving a full five stars, was the lack of air conditioning. The room was uncomfortably warm and I struggled to get a good night’s sleep due to the heat. If this issue were resolved, it would be a near-perfect stay.

Would definitely return,provided the weather wasn't too warm.

She greet me with a big smile and helped me place my order timely with ease.
I love this branch🥰i always come here and all the members of staff treat me well. This Domino’s never misses.

Highly recommend this spot, especially the Texas BBQ and Chicken Kickers—top tier every time.

Rocky This review is more to do with the chain rather than the franchise, though the franchise could also do better. We order for home delivery from Domino's often as one of the kids won't even try other restaurants. The ordering remains a very frustrating experience - there are so many deals, which really are not deals as no one would buy these 'full price' without the deals. The deals are confusing and  unlike other chains the best deal is not automatically applied. Would you believe that two small portions of side are cheaper than one 'standard portion'? The portion size of the sides are small, considering the price. The toppings are getting smaller over the years. The food sometimes arrive lukewarm.

The starters we ordered were absolutely delicious full of flavour and beautifully presented. Although there was a wait of over 45 minutes for the starters, the food was so outstanding that we didn’t mind. Every dish exceeded expectations rich in taste, perfectly seasoned, and clearly made with care. It’s difficult to express just how much we enjoyed the flavours; the culinary experience alone made the visit worthwhile.

The manager made a genuine effort to check in with customers, which we appreciated. However, the gentleman who took our order seemed a little off that evening. At one point, we were told our water bottle might be “confiscated,” which came across quite harshly especially as one of us carries water for medical reasons. A more thoughtful approach and choice of words would have made a big difference. That aside, the service overall could benefit from a bit more consistency and attentiveness.

Special credit goes to the Shisha team friendly, welcoming, and great at what they do. The Shisha itself was excellent and added to the overall experience.

The food is truly exceptional, and with some improvement in service delivery, this place could easily be a five star experience. Came to this restaurant for a friends birthday meal and everything was beyond perfect. Firstly, the decor and interior inside the restaurant is perfect for pictures and has aesthetic backgrounds. The food was stunning and came in perfect portion size! (The food can be quite spicy so if you don’t like spice ask for mild). However, we had Yasmin as our waitress for the night and she was amazing! She made sure we had a brilliant night by being polite, having good general communication and warning us about the spicy food 🤣. The restaurant treats you very well and gave the birthday girl a bottle of ‘nosecco’ and a birthday card which was very appreciated. We all also bought the birthday girl the “birthday platter” which i would 100% recommend!! Honestly, this place is worth the visit and Yasmin is the waitress to hope for! I had an amazing experience at Argeela Lounge! The ambiance is stunning, with a design-driven interior that creates a unique and stylish atmosphere. The food was absolutely delicious—tried the sandwiches and dessert, and both were beautifully presented and full of flavor. The drinks menu was impressive too, with a great selection of cocktails. The staff were friendly and attentive, making the evening even more enjoyable. Highly recommend for a dynamic dining experience, especially if you’re a fan of shisha and live events. Can’t wait to come back! Absolutely AMAZING 💫💫😍.  Food, service, everything was over an above.  We didn't book ahead but got accommodated within 20 mins and our waiters T and Aaron was so friendly, so helpful & 1 of the main reasons (apart from the food) why I will definitely  be returning 💙🙏🏾 Luv Lovelife Dan Had an amazing night at Argeela and just had to shout out Tee and Jak for their outstanding service. From the moment we walked in, they made us feel welcome, looked after us with genuine warmth, and were super attentive without being overbearing.

The vibe at Argeela is always great, but having staff like Tee and Jaq really takes the experience to another level. Our drinks came out quickly, food recommendations were on point (the lamb was 🔥), and they checked in just the right amount to make sure we were happy.

Where breakfast meets bargain and the pints flow freer than the traffic outside.

Dropped into the Figure of Eight on a brisk Birmingham morning—Broad Street still yawning from the night before—for a no-fuss traditional breakfast. Verdict? Somewhere between average and actually-not-bad-at-all. But here’s the thing: for the price, it was more than adequate—it’s Wetherspoons, not The Ritz.

You know the drill: sausage, egg, beans, toast, and hash browns that could stop a hangover in its tracks. The coffee? Bottomless. Refill ’til your soul stops screaming. It’s a JD institution, like sticky menus and gents debating politics at 10am.

Now, let’s talk booze. Cheapest in the land. You could build a pyramid of pints for the price of a single cocktail elsewhere. And there’s something comforting about that classic Spoons setup—wooden booths, sticky floors, and a drinks menu as thick as a Dickens novel.

In summary:
Not a culinary pilgrimage, but for a breakfast with caffeine on tap and change left over for a cheeky morning lager, the Figure of Eight does exactly what it says on the tin. And then some.

Rating: 7/10 – mostly for the price, the bottomless brew, and the familiar Spoons charm. Enjoyed their breakfast hospitality. Absolutely spot on. This has set me up for the day.
Oh, special mention for the Benghazi, on the same floor. No staircase required. Boom! Warm chocolate fudge cake is really tasty and not too sickly sweet like you can sometimes get at other restaurants. Service was fine but check your cutlery as when I got mine the spoon hadn't been cleaned properly and was just gross. Dirty table, nobody bothered to come round to wipe our table after requesting this at the bar. Food was not enjoyable, not even average. On the plus side, it looks quite a nice place and could be just that with a bit more effort and better food. And Strongbow is back which was good. But  I' ll gladly pay more somewhere else going forward. A nice restaurant with a wide range of food choices and dining areas, all in one premise. Unique, one of its kind.
Food is good, fantastic taste. Service is good.
Free refills of soft drinks and beverages if you order with drinks.
Prices are affordable.
A comfortable place to wee the hours away. You can choose to read a book or get online on your notebook and even play a slot machine.
You can dine in the in house air-conditioning area or at their open space backyard.

A big thank you to Sakshi for her amazing service. She was super friendly and bubbly, and took the time to explain the dishes to us in detail, which really helped us choose the perfect meal. Her warm and cheerful attitude made the experience even better. Great food, great staff. highly recommend! The service at this Hyderabad wala Birmingham restaurant was extremely disappointing, and the staff was impolite. I ordered fried piece biryani, but instead, they served a dish with a tomato-flavored gravy and cold chicken pieces. When we explained the issue to the waiter, he dismissively insisted it was fried piece biryani and told us to eat it, claiming it would taste nice. I’ve never encountered such an unprofessional response.

Additionally, the family dum biryani we ordered for our group was served cold, completely lacking in flavor and hygiene. As a Hyderabadi, I know what authentic biryani should taste like, but this was utterly disappointing. They couldn’t even manage to serve hot food, let alone focus on taste or quality. I seriously question how this restaurant meets food hygiene and safety standards.

I strongly recommend avoiding this place. It’s a waste of time and money, especially given their poor hygiene and substandard service. Licked Clean My Plate - Just wanted to share my thoughts on a few dishes I’ve tried so far at Hyderabad Wala — figured it’s finally time to write a little something.

Chicken Dum Biryani – hands down 10/10. If you like your food spicy (like I do — the spicier the better), this place hits the spot. You can actually talk to the restaurant about the spice level, which is great. The rice was super fragrant and packed with flavor. I usually only have biryani every few months, but in the last 3 weeks alone, I’ve already had it three times here. That says something!

Tried the Chicken Liver with Tandoori Naan today — wow. It was amazing and honestly made me a bit homesick. Haven’t had liver since I was back home, and this took me right back. So good.

Then we had the Masala Chai — it comes in a smaller cup than I’d usually go for, but considering the price, it makes sense. Plus, it was really good! Totally recommend it after your meal.

The vibe at the place is great, and the service has been one of the best I’ve experienced in Birmingham so far. It gets pretty busy in the evenings, but it’s super chill during the day — perfect if you’re looking to grab lunch and maybe get some work done (I usually catch up on emails there).

Probably my longest review yet, but definitely worth writing. I’ll keep updating as I try more dishes! Great food🤤 Apollo fish is a must try. And the Rice Kheer was 💯. Table service is also great. Overall a good choice if you want to try Hyderabad food and Indian food mostly. Such good food and such good service. Cute small restaurant with amazing South Indian food. Highly recommend.

From the moment we walked in without a reservation, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality. The staff went out of their way to ensure we were well taken care of, making us feel like VIPs throughout our visit.

Now, the food – absolutely fantastic! Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. The quality of the ingredients really shone through, and you could tell that a lot of care and attention had been put into every plate. Whether it was the starters, mains, or desserts, each course exceeded our expectations.

The service was attentive yet unobtrusive, with the staff providing helpful recommendations without being overbearing. It's rare to find such a perfect balance of excellent food and top-tier service. I would highly recommend Fumo to anyone in the area – whether you're a local or just visiting, this restaurant is an absolute must! We’ll definitely be returning. I had a terrible dining experience at Fumo by San Carlo (Waterloo Street, Birmingham). I ordered the lobster pasta, and it was absolutely awful. The lobster meat had a very strange taste—dry, rubbery, and completely unpleasant. It was nothing like fresh lobster or even decent seafood. Honestly, the dish was barely edible.

When I raised the issue with the manager, I was met with a shockingly arrogant and dismissive attitude. He flat-out refused to explain anything or acknowledge the problem, showing no interest in customer satisfaction at all.

This place pretends to be upscale, but the food quality is poor and the service is even worse. I strongly advise everyone to avoid this location. There are other Fumo branches in Birmingham—make sure you don’t end up at the Waterloo Street one. It’s simply not worth your time or money. Went to Fumo with my partner and honestly, I left pretty disappointed. The food tasted alright, but both of us ended up with stomach issues not long after, which kind of ruined the whole experience.
We ordered the pizza, and it was tiny. Like, ridiculously small. It looked like two slices rather than an actual pizza. Not at all what we expected, and definitely not filling. I left the place still hungry. To make it worse, the food was really expensive for what we got. The portion size just didn’t match the price at all.We also had the millefoglie for dessert, and that was another letdown. The puff pastry was soft and soggy, like it had been sitting in the fridge all day—not the light, crunchy texture you’d hope for.
All in all, it just wasn’t a good time. I don’t think I’ll be going back. Maybe if you’re just after a small snack or something quick with a drink, it might be okay—but if you’re looking for a proper meal, I’d say skip this place. Quick service, food is fresh and delicious. Service elevates the experience, servers care about your food and order. Food ordered in pictures: spaghetti with mussels, stuffed prawn pasta, and carbonara. Cocktails expensive but taste of value. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Fantastic Atmosphere & Great Drinks!
This place has everything you want in a great bar—amazing ambiance, skilled bartenders, and a fantastic selection of drinks! The cocktails are well-crafted and balanced, and they even have an impressive list of wines and craft beers. The staff is friendly and attentive, making sure you always have a great experience.

Whether you're out celebrating or just looking to have a good time with friends, ""Be at one"" is definitely the place to be. I would like to share my bad experience at your establishment. During my last visit, a barmaid was particularly unpleasant: she spoke in a curt and impolite manner, without taking the time to listen to customers or respond properly to their requests. We clearly felt like we were intruding, as if we were a nuisance. This lack of respect and professionalism seriously detracts from the atmosphere of the bar. It's a real shame, because the place itself has potential. I hope this can be taken into account to improve the welcome in the future.

First time at this restaurant and the good reviews are deserved.  Staff were attentive and gave us great recommendations, which we took and didn't regret.

Do try this little gem of a restaurant. **An Outstanding Dining Experience – Top-Notch Food & Service**

From start to finish, our experience was nothing short of exceptional. The food was absolutely delicious, and the customer service was truly first class – warm, attentive, and genuine.

We began with a generous serving of crispy *poppadoms*, accompanied by a delightful variety of chutneys and relishes – each sauce brought its own unique flavor, from tangy to sweet to spicy. A perfect way to whet the appetite.

For starters, we opted for the *Chicken Tikka* and *Papri Chaat*. The chicken was incredibly tender, marinated to perfection, and bursting with flavor. The papri chaat was a lovely mix of textures and tastes – crisp, creamy, tangy, and just the right amount of spice. Portion sizes were generous without being overwhelming.

Our mains included *Saag Chicken* and *Paneer Makhani*, served with freshly baked *Tandoori Roti*. Both dishes were outstanding – rich, flavorful, and well-balanced in spices. The saag chicken had a beautiful depth of flavor, while the paneer makhani was creamy and comforting, with a slight sweetness that paired beautifully with the spiced gravy. The medium spice level was spot on for us – just enough heat to excite the palate without overpowering the dish.

For dessert, we shared *Gulab Jamun with Ice Cream* alongside a cup of aromatic *Masala Chai*. The gulab jamun was warm, soft, and syrupy – complemented perfectly by the cool ice cream. The masala tea had just the right blend of spices and sweetness, making for a lovely, comforting end to our meal.

We’re regular diners at places like Dishoom, Asha’s, and Varanasi – and we can confidently say this restaurant holds its own among them. In fact, the level of customer service here may even surpass the others – the staff truly made us feel welcomed and valued.

Looking forward to our next visit – a new favorite on our dining list! This place is very very good. Nepalese/Indian cuisine. We had the vegetarian platter, vegetarian momo and chicken momos for starters all very well presented and super tasty and perfectly spiced. For mains we had one of the chicken curries and Palak Paneer again perfectly spiced and flavourful. The cocktails I’ve got to say are high quality and better than cocktail bars around the city. They are unique and masterfully made. I’d go back just for the drinks. I also had Cobra beer on tap too. To finish we had the dessert platter. Very well presented but the Jalabi and Ras malai could have been a lot better. I’m Indian and know my Indian food well so I feel that most people who haven’t eaten these types of desserts in the past will love them from here.

The star of the show was our waitress. Truly an amazing member of the team. Lovely and polite manner and very funny too and an absolute delight. She made the evening so much better and have to say one of the best waitresses/waiters we’ve ever encountered. She haloed us choose the right things based on what we told her about our tastes.

There are better options than this. Rude! I dont really make reviews but well. I Ordered a hot white americano takeaway to 3 people and nobody seems to finish the order.

Throughout the delicious meal and even after, Ellen made us feel very welcomed and cared for- she has a radiating energy that was very appreciated.

The salmon was fresh and flavoursome. Shame no Soft Shell Crab available which is the exclusive for Selfridges. The food is okay, you know what you're getting with a sushi chain. Sadly they didn't have a main ingredient that meant there were a couple of dishes I couldn't order. Staff could have been more attentive, I had to keep flagging them down to order more. It's a shame they didn't have the bells to ask for service like other yo sushi's had. Overall it's okay if you need a quick and easy lunch. Our waiter Jose was incredible ! He made our entire stay infinitely more enjoyable! He was very patient and helpfully even though we were a bit rowdy. 11/10 for the staff!!! The food is delicious but the portions were more on the small size. Flies in the Soy Sauce!!!!

1st time ever going to a Yo Sushi, took my wife there as she enjoys Sushi. She took a plate of the turn table and started to dig in, she added some soy sauce to her food and a small fly came out. Now 1 fly can be some what normal I guess but I turned my flash light on my phone and put it at the bottom of the soy sauce bottle and there was about 10 flies in there. Which now shows me they haven’t cleaned the bottles out in god knows how long! Yuk!! The waiter removed the bottle and brought us a new one but it wasn’t a trusted bottle after that. After she did take the 2 trays off our bill but it was very off putting being our 1st time there. Do I dare give Yo Sushi another chance? We wanted a quick and light lunch so we picked Yo! Sushi. Whilst the place is tastefully decorated, the food is rather disappointing. The flavors are not wholesome leaving more room for improvement. The sauces are typically central kitchen delivered sauces. The beef teriyaki is hard and over powered by the taste of shoyu. The curry pumpkin croquet has little flavor. The sushi rolls were mushy indicating that the rice has been over cooked.

The atmosphere was nice, and the food arrived in a timely fashion. The QR code made it quick and easy to pay, and you can split the bill too. This was a very enjoyable dining experience. I was quite disappointed with my dining experience today. One of the main courses was served significantly earlier than the rest, and the second only arrived after we reminded the staff—by which time my friend had already finished eating. While I really enjoyed the honey firecracker wings, the curries were underwhelming and not to our taste.

Given the pricing, we expected a higher standard, both in terms of food and service. Unfortunately, the customer service fell short. The general manager of the store was really professional and welcoming but our waitress seemed disengaged—she placed the food and change on the table without a word and didn’t check in with us at any point during the meal. There was no sense of warmth or attentiveness, which really affected the overall experience which left a negative impression overall. It’s a shame, as we were looking forward to the meal. We visited here Friday 14th around 1pm. The food was amazing, the drinks were great and the service was 5star.
We were served by Jack and he was super attentive and friendly, he made us feel extremly welcome and as if we were the only people he was serving.
He took my Moms allergies to gluten super seriously and explained everything they would do to cater to her allergies, which is great as she is always dubious eating out due to lack of care, which had made her ill, in the past.
Food was delicious and served quickly Wagamama Birmingham truly impressed us! The food was tasty, well-presented, and fairly priced. Perfect for a relaxed evening out. Our server David was outstanding: cheerful, engaging, and couldn’t have been more helpful. His friendly vibe and great humour added a lovely energy to the whole meal.

Luckily, I'm not a vegetarian, but that's beside the point, it shouldn't have been on my plate in the first place. Whatever you go, Wetherspoon will be an option.

We went to The Square of peg, and sorry I can’t give 5 stars because my fish not was how expected in the size.

But the rest of the dishes was okay, and good portion for kids size.

We had fish and chips, chips, kids sausages, American Burguer and melt chicken(is small portion)

The location is perfect and inside is masive, clean, and with staff friendly.

Is a place to go with kids, and also a good option for a cuppa tea or coffee, because they have the cheapest hot drinks.

If you came to the heart of Birmingham, and you don’t have a lot of money, go to a Wetherspoon, special between 9-12 you can have amazing prices with you breakfast l.

It was cool that you order and pay from an app and the waiters bring the food to you with very minimum contact. It's a unique place with a warm atmosphere, would definitely go back. Love a weather's breakky anywhere i go but this one was just the nicest ive had for ages everything was cooked to perfection 👌 👍 🥰 Horrible service.

The pub was busy. Highly recommended. The Shakespeare is a fairly standard pub adjacent to New Street Station. I sank a quick pint of Neck Oil here before meeting some friends, and it did the job.

Highly recommend this place if you’re into Japanese food (or even if you’re not – you’ll still love it!). Already planning my next visit! The staff here are so friendly and accommodating.

We were a group of 10. At the end they gave us the 700£ bill. The manager was rude and thick when we pointed out that we wanted to pay separately.

The waiting staff were all brilliant though.

Also. At the end, you get herded out. The waiting area is too small. You can't move because you're knocking into incoming or leaving people.

Nice food but I'd never return. We had the individual choice menus and it was absolutely delicious. Food served as a series of starters with the cooking of the main course a performance, which was entertaining. Portions were good and the service impeccable. Thoroughly enjoyed our evening.

Major improvements needed

They have limited selection and the selection is cold so they microwave the food to be hot.

The grilled chicken wings flavour was okay but they are such small wings it’s not worth the price.

It’s a new business and I’m sad to leave such a review but they need major improvements if they are to survive.

Simplify the menu and TASTE the menu. The lamb curry was not good or the rice - over laced with cardamom.

Advice: sort your menu out and maybe find a better chef because the food is not good. Smelly place, I ordered lamb curry with chapati. Lamb curry was extremely oily hot and bones only wasted my money. Very bad food. If you're stuck for a place to eat in town look no further than this simple Pakistani Afghani takeaway grill shop.

I’ve been shopping at M&S FOOD for nearly 20 years & never felt the need to write a review, but their cookies deserve it. Honestly, they are the best cookies I’ve ever had. They come in three flavours, classic choc chip, triple choc and oat The triple choc are my go-to. They’re unbelievably tasty, rich, & baked to perfection.
Recently, they released a new filled range, hazelnut chocolate, raspberry cheesecake & pistachio. They’re good, but nothing beats the original cookies!
Now for the warning! These cookies turn people into contestants on Supermarket Sweep. The moment they hit the shelves it’s chaos, trolleys crashing, people diving like it’s the Olympics, & that one person pretending to browse while secretly guarding the last pack. If you don’t get there early, you’ll be left standing in the crumbs wondering what just happened. Good Luck!! Caution! Chinese customer please don't go there.
had an extremely upsetting experience at this M&S Foodhall in Selly Oak. ( some other people in Chinese community also have similar experience )Upon entering the store, I was stopped by a security guard who wrongly claimed that I had previously shoplifted with others and was on a “ban list.” He was adamant, even though I had not been to the store in over a week, and accused me without showing any evidence—just based on facial recognition, which is both inaccurate and discriminatory.

I requested to speak with the manager, who eventually reviewed the footage and confirmed I had not been involved in any wrongdoing. Only then was I allowed to enter. After purchasing two bottles of drinks and showing the receipt, the guard finally let me go, but without any apology or accountability for the humiliation I endured.

The whole experience felt like racial profiling, and left me feeling deeply embarrassed and angry. As a paying customer and a student living in the area, I expect to be treated with basic respect and fairness, not suspicion and hostility.

M&S, please train your staff—especially security—to handle such situations more professionally, and not to assume guilt based on appearance. This was not just a mistake; it was a deeply damaging and humiliating experience. This Store Is not for me..it was my first time going that store and it will be my last time...

The place is really organized and nice, but unfortunately you don't feel comfortable there.
When you enter the place you feel that all the workers are watching you Every time you move a worker comes next to you and pretends like he wants to organize something or checking something,
On top of that, it's very expensive. For example, I wanted to buy Peuneut butter, 50 grams or 100 grams i don'tremember exactly  they selling for £2.70. And everywhere else it's £0.90 or £1.10.

That's was my experience and my opinion. Have to say the staff in here are wonderful. Always on hand and so helpful. Store is always clean and neat but the main reason for this review is to praise the lovely people who work there. The stuff of this store have discrimination to Asian people, the security guard mistook innocent people to past shop lifter, and the manager still accompanied with me during the whole shopping experience although after i proved my innocence, and asked me to print a receipt for permission to leave, they are actually poor racists",0.4,0.6,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Emotional Tone""]","['store', 'cookies', 'guard', 'people', 'security', 'don', 'triple', 'security guard', 'deeply', 'showing']","[""security guard"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""store"", ""triple"", ""Service"", ""deeply"", ""Dessert"", ""guard"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""people"", ""cookies"", ""security"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""don"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Value"", ""Experience"", ""showing""]"

The service was great, there was enough staff around if we needed assistance.  Cameron was fab and happy to help with any queries. The food was hot and served with enough time between courses.
A few more carrots/parsnips would have been nice, I only had 2 pieces of carrot and 1 parsnip and roast potatoes could be improved they tasted like ‘aunt Bessie’s’ but overall a great experience. Came here on Wednesday evening with a friend for dinner.
Nice, cosy atmosphere and got a table by the fire.

We had the 3 courses deal each for 13.95 which I thought was a great price.

We had

Chicken wings
Breaded mushrooms
Lasagne x 2
Creme brulee
Chocolate orange sponge

All the food was really good. Loved the breaded mushrooms.

My only feedback is that the service was slow between courses. We had to ask for our dessert after waiting around 30 mins after finishing our mains.

But overall a nice evening and good food and I would return. Came for the first time today, had the rainbow lasagne which was great. Bit of a delay with my drink but soon sorted, nice place.

I got robbed. This is not premium meat, it tastes like lamb from the local butcher shop standard quality. The buger is also burnt and crispy so are the fries. I will never ever be coming back to this place tiniest portions my kids would need two meals, very disappointed would definitely not recommend this place to a soul, staff are clueless aswell  not good at all I ordered an egg muffin at this place as take away just now and found two pieces of hair in them. So unacceptable and unhygienic. Chai & Crumbs is a solid choice for anyone looking to enjoy food in a clean and welcoming setting. The menu offers a good variety of dishes, and everything we tried was freshly prepared and full of flavour. You can tell the ingredients are of good quality just by taking the first bite.

The service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere had a relaxed, comfortable feel—perfect for a laid-back bite or catching up with friends.

Definitely worth checking out if you’re in the area and after a satisfying Halal meal. I had been wanting to visit here for months, since I saw this place featured on a Rick Stein programme and, as it says on my profile, I am a lover of chai lattes so love to visit places where this is served. We tried to book a table but the email received to our request was non- committal to this and when I arrived, the server knew nothing of our booking. There was a table however and liked the vibe and look of the place. First the food, between the three of us we went for a desi breakfast, Shakshuka, halloumi hash and shared a loaded cheese fries (originally went for the loaded nachos but out of stock) All the food absolutely delicious and would return to try more dishes as really good selection of veggie food. However the disappointment was the chai! After discussion with the server of options, I ordered what I thought was going to be a pumpkin spice chai latte. Unfortunately when it arrived, it contained coffee which I absolutely can't stand or stomach!! I returned it and the server apologised and I was given a second drink. Despite my adding several sugars, this was completely undrinkable as very powdery and bitter. My third attempt at a drink was a standard masala chai, which I took away with me but to be honest, it was on par with the masala chai teabags I use at home. Food great and if you are not a coffee phobic like me, you will probably like the drinks but unfortunately I was disappointed with the chai drinks, which I had been looking forward to trying.

Effectively it means JD Sports supports violence against women. Outstanding Service – Thank You Felix!
I had a challenging experience at first due to some confusion around an online order and delays in delivery, but everything turned around thanks to Felix, the store manager at JD Sports Birmingham New Street.

Felix was incredibly professional, kind, and genuinely cared about helping me. After hearing that I had an international flight the next day and had already faced stress due to the situation, he stepped in personally, offered me a special discount, and helped me find exactly what I needed — all while making sure I left with my order on time.

His attitude and support made all the difference. This wasn’t just great service — it was a lifesaver. Thank you, Felix, for your outstanding help, and thank you JD Sports for having someone like him on your team. The service here is awful, would not recommend. This is a long review so buckle up. I already knew what shoes I wanted to buy when I walked in so I picked it off the shelf and asked for my size. He then gave the shoe to a different colleage and told me it would be 2 minutes. 5 minutes pass and still no shoes. I ask the person who took the shoe off me in the first place and he was like ""oh let me check"". Another couple minutes go by and I finally get given the shoes to try on (I'm between sizes and it varies brand to brand so I had to try them on) but for security reasons(?) I was only given one. I tried it on and it was slightly too large so I asked for the next size down instead. This time ANOTHER staff member when to get them and were gone a long time. Then after 10 minutes they saw me from across the room, gave the shocked pikachu face as if they forgot me and then held up 2 fingers and mouthed ""give me two secs"". After a couple more minutes I had the shoes and they put them behind the till. After waiting in line for what felt like an eternity, the cashier just felt rude and I was so done by that point I just wanted to pay and leave. Won't shop there again, lesson learned I guess. As I Used to work in JD sports as a youngster back in 1996 I was Mortified at the service received what’s happened I spent over 120 pounds on two pairs of Junior trainers the lad who served me took an eternity to go to the small lift to get the trainers  instead wanted to joke about and act up with his work pals who looked liked thay get paid just to doss round a Till point

Eventually paying for the trainers the lady well girl should I say looked miffed because I’d come to buy and she had to stop laughing with her mate to serve me I say serve it was anything but she never said please never said thank you she literally said card ! I thought this has to be like a little Brittan hidden camera show or some joke where they all burst out laughing and say your on camera

She then said there’s a system era pay again not sorry or anything in the way of apology I had to ask on the sales assistant if or when I’d get a refund has two payments had come out my bank few days was her reply I loved the way she just assumed I’d have another 120 pounds two pay twice she handed my receipts and literally turned her back on me it was me saying thanks then !

Honestly I’d have lasted half a day back in my day with that sh** And then I’d have been walked out and said retails not for you what’s happening John , David sports do a mystery shop see for yourself,s what you paying these kids for ?

Do NOT make the mistake I did by driving here on my last few miles of fuel.

They couldn't be bothered to even change it on the Google to show its temporary closed until further notice!

GO TO ANOTHER SHELL! Wrongly Accused of Fuel Theft. Still unresolved!

I visited this station on 20/04/2025 around 4:50 PM, filled up with £39.89 of fuel, and purchased a pint of milk and baby wipes, paying £42.40 in full through the service window (as the shop was closed).

Despite this, I later received a letter from a third-party company (ForecourtEye) claiming I had stolen fuel — an accusation based solely on the word of the garage manager. I have provided bank statements proving I paid the full amount, yet they continue to pursue me, refusing to supply any receipt, CCTV or breakdown of what was sold.

To make things worse, they’re claiming I purchased AdBlue, which is impossible — I drive a petrol Vauxhall Corsa, which doesn’t use it!

This experience has been stressful, damaging, and completely unfair. It reflects very poorly on how this forecourt is run, and I hope Shell and others take action to prevent this from happening to other innocent customers.

I would advise anyone using this site to keep their receipts and be cautious. I parked to charge my EV car for 1 hour 23 minutes, unfortunately I received a parking 2 tickets for overstayed while to charge my car to maximun is at least 1h30' for chargers unders 150Kwa I ordered a package from Amazon to be delivered to a drop-off point at a petrol station. The address was specified, and I went to collect my parcel between 1:00 and 2:00 PM on November 22nd. However, when I arrived, the staff informed me that I had to wait until they finished serving all the customers refueling their vehicles. They said their priority was petrol sales, and only afterward would they assist with Amazon services.

This is disappointing, as it creates confusion and poor customer service for Amazon users. If the petrol station cannot handle Amazon services effectively, they shouldn’t partner with Amazon. I waited for several minutes while multiple customers were served, and eventually, I got fed up and left without my parcel.

I wouldn’t recommend choosing this petrol station as an Amazon drop-off point, as they don’t provide satisfactory service to Amazon customers. Arrived to shell station after work at 22.30 to top up fuel, where I’m regular customer. The cashier didn’t opened tap for fuel and just staring at me, after said via microphone pay first. The door was locked to a store. True the window he said pay first then put fuel. I inform that able to pay by card or Apple Pay and I need to scan my member car first and he still insists to pay first. How I’m supposed to pay if not sure how much would car need it?
Definitely this is not the way you expect to be treating a young lady, who tired after work and looking to top up fuel before go back to work again in early morning. The same cashier served me many time earlier morning at 6:20am.
Was so hard to be more loyal ?

ChIJV-BmKWC8cEgRY8s9bXAOtB4,B&B HOTEL Birmingham Centre,"Holloway Head, Birmingham B1 1NS, UK",4.1,1711.0,0.58988,5,4,1,0,52.4738349,-1.902504,N/A,"This happened last Saturday.

I ordered a breakfast bag from this hotel through the Too Good To Go app. The collection time was clearly stated as 10:00–10:30 AM. I arrived at the hotel around 10:10, only to be informed by a woman with glasses that the pickup time had been changed to 10:30. She simply told me, “You can either wait or leave.”

I explained that I had something  to do at 10:30 and couldn’t wait. When I asked why I wasn’t informed earlier, she said it was a third-party app and had nothing to do with them. To me, this clearly sounded like an attempt to avoid responsibility.

I find it hard to believe that Too Good To Go wouldn’t have informed me immediately if they had been notified in time. In fact, the app only sent the time change notification at 10:18 AM—by which point I had already left the hotel. This suggests either the hotel informed the platform too late, or didn’t inform them at all.

What was even more frustrating was the lack of effort from the hotel staff to resolve the issue on the spot. No apology, no solution—just “you can wait or leave.”

Although the amount of money involved was small, the hotel’s dismissive attitude was extremely disappointing. It shows poor staff training and a lack of concern for customer experience. The staff member I dealt with was unprofessional and unhelpful.

If the hotel caused the delay, they should have taken responsibility and tried to help—not just shifted the blame and left the customer with no option.

I wasn’t planning to leave a negative review, but the way this was handled left me no choice. I hope this helps others understand what to expect, and I sincerely hope the hotel takes steps to improve their service.

I also sent a formal complaint email to the hotel management shortly after the incident. It has now been four days, and I’ve received no response at all—not even an acknowledgment.

I didn’t expect much in terms of compensation, but I did expect at least a reply or some sign that the issue was being taken seriously. Sadly, this lack of response only confirms my impression: the hotel does not care about customer feedback, nor does it take responsibility for its service failures. Great value for money, stayed 1 night for Guns n Roses concert. Lovely staff, spotless twin room, great breakfast with good variety for any taste (traditional British or lighter selections). Easy to find, close to railway. Enjoy a few games of American pool after breakfast before our departure. Would stay again if ever return to Birmingham) The bar area on the first floor was gorgeous. So it's a shame that after August, it won't be there because the look doesn't fit the B&B look.
Aside from this, the hotel is in a great spot with easy access to restaurants and bars, and the staff are really friendly. We paid £195 for a double room with breakfast and chose the hotel mainly because it had its own parking. Unfortunately, we only found out after booking that the car park was closed due to refurbishment. If we’d known that beforehand, we probably would’ve gone with a different hotel.

Check-in was great—really quick and easy, and the staff were friendly. But when we got to the room, there was a note (attached) apologising for the noise from the refurb works. We could hear really loud and ongoing building noise, which made it hard to relax.

We completely understand that renovations need to happen, but for the price we paid, it was quite disappointing—especially when we weren’t told about the disruption in advance.

As others had noted, the room was quite warm without air con but fortunately it was manageable.

Breakfast however was great value for money. There was plenty to choose from and good quality products. The staff member in the breakfast room was very friendly and efficient at clearing up empty plates/bowls. Honestly, THE best hotel stay for a city. From the moment I arrived everything was perfect.

We went on Sunday at 4.00 pm. Food tasty and beautifully presented. Service outstanding. Venue nice and bright, a change from some dark, dingy and close Indian restaurants. They went the extra mile and really looked after us. Price, reasonable given we had 3 courses. staff are really nice and friendly. All together high recommended to visit and try some Nepalese food. We went here just yesterday for my husband's birthday and the owner and waitress were so attentive to all of our needs (16 of us may I add), including all my young nieces. The food was very flavoursome not over-spiced or bland like other restaurants, who think flavour doesn't matter. Everyone had a great time and the head waiter even sang happy birthday and brought the cake over for my husband. 5/5 highly recommend! Very cosy place in the heart of Jewellery Quarter, great atmosphere with even greater food, staff and owner are very nice and kind. It is slightly on pricier side, but no regrets on the food, especially when its one of a kind Nepalese kitchen around. Definitely would recommend to anyone to try at least once. Menu has a lot of variety, so anyone should find something to like. Stop, wait a minute, think, reflect. “Did I just experience something off the charts?” My mind was blown following a visit to Jojolapa Nepalese Bar & Restaurant.
The restaurant looks diminutive as you pass it by on the street. Enter and behold, this is no ordinary restaurant. JoJolapa’s interior queues matches its culinary intentions. It is best described as fusion: Nepalese meets Indian meets British hipster. The light pours in from the skylight giving the comfortable, lounging dining area an inviting warmth.
The service is exceptional, the concept of JoJolapa, it’s dishes and its soul are explained in detail. I recommend letting them guide you. Go on, try dishes that will open your chakra to a whole new world of food.
The pick of the dishes, for me, was the soya tikka biriyani. If I was to describe it better, it is a Nan topped rice and (Meat,vegetables,vegan meat) pie delivered with a side of curry sauce. What an amazing dish; I had to ask the serving staff if they’d accidentally served me actual chicken given how convincing the soya chicken was.

Title: Deeply Disappointed – Would Not Recommend

We were genuinely excited to host our wedding here, but the experience fell far short of expectations. The air conditioning in both the venue and rooms was completely inadequate — the unit was visibly dirty, leaking, and not cooling the space, causing our £600 wedding cake to collapse by the evening. This was especially frustrating as we had been told it would be fine if the room was climate-controlled — which it clearly wasn’t.

There was no proper duty manager after 7 PM despite prior assurances. When issues came up later in the evening — such as missing food allergy labels — there was no one clearly in charge to handle it.

The hotel stay was also a nightmare. We had to get our room keys sorted six times, staff seemed unaware of our bookings, and the room aircon didn’t work, forcing us to leave the balcony door open all night. Since our wedding, we’ve seen similar reviews which confirms these are recurring problems.

After the event, we raised all these issues and asked to escalate the complaint. Our request was ignored, and the response we received was dismissive.

A wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime occasion — and we left feeling let down, stressed, and incredibly disappointed. Based on our experience, we would not recommend this venue to future couples. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!
POOR SERVICE!!
POOR ROOM CONDITIONS!!

I stayed at this hotel for my wedding, expecting a comfortable and enjoyable experience, but unfortunately, I was met with poor service.
Raising complaints will be a waste of time because they will not follow up with you.

* Room Conditions: The room was extremely hot and uncomfortable. I had no option but to sleep with the balcony door open, which made the room very noisy throughout the night, affecting my ability to rest.
* Poor Room Maintenance: The curtains in the room were falling apart, contributing to a substandard experience that was far below what I anticipated.
* Check-in Problems: Upon arrival, I was given the wrong key card and had to check in again to resolve the issue.
* Access Issues and Poor Customer Service: My sister’s key card stopped working at around 9 PM. She attempted to find staff at reception on six separate occasions, and nobody was available until much later. When someone was finally located, she was issued a new key but was then told that no one should be staying in the room – despite the room having been paid for. This left her confused and concerned.

Very disappointed and would not recommend. If I knew that this was gonna be the case i would have 💯 chose a different hotel for my wedding. Deeply Disappointed!

We had a highly disappointing experience at The Cube Hotel. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that this was not going to live up to its advertised standards. The reception staff were completely unresponsive — calls went unanswered repeatedly, making it impossible to get any assistance when needed.

The room was another letdown. The air conditioning was broken, and with no windows to open for fresh air, the space quickly became uncomfortable and stifling. For the high price paid, we expected at least the basics to function properly.

This hotel does not even come close to a 4-star standard. In fact, we’ve stayed in far better hotels across Africa that offered outstanding service and comfort at a fraction of the price.

Overall, The Cube Hotel was a complete disaster. I would not recommend it to anyone. Horrible experience!!!

Stay away from this place! NO AC at all, and you will have to enjoy the sauna I the hot summer!

What will make you even worse is the black female (her name is Kesha!!!)  at the front desk. She is super rude and keeps saying “ check in starts at 3pm” even we are here at 2:40! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!!! I WISH ALL YOU FAMILY WILL HAVE A GOOD TIME WHEN CHECK IN KESHA!!!

Def stay away from this place until they hire a good person NOT THIS KESHA! We had a lunch for two voucher, with a glass of prosecco each, staff were very friendly and could not do enough for us.
I had the liver parfait on sourdough bread to start with a wild berry and fig jam which was lovely , my partner had the roasted vine tomato soup which she really enjoyed , for mains I had the steak cooked blue which was gorgeous and melted in the mouth with fries and side salad and a bowl of pepper sauce, my partner has the chicken escalope which was very nice but a bit overcooked.
Overall would rate it a 8.5/10 the main room looked a bit tired and the service area needed a bit of refurbishment.

The staff was nice and attentive. The food was SO good. They have a very large menu with set menus, vegetarian options and more. The Mango Pudding we had for dessert was a bit too simple but definitely recommend all the rest. We shared a starter, got a main and dessert for around £20 pp. I had pork noodles, my wife had crispy pork with rice alongside Wanton Soup. With pepsi as the drink. The drinks were great 500ml in tall glasses. I liked my pork noodles, the portion is massive and it's best in buffet. I had to take it back in a doggy bag. The crispy pork was lovely too. My wife thought the wantons in the soup were not seasoned enough and it did feel.like this. The service was good and felt quick. For some reason, we haven't been here for a couple of years (probably because there are just so many great places to eat at in Birmingham these days).
So, it was lovely to head back to Ching Ying Garden and attempt to eat our bodyweight in Dim Sum.

I love that you order what you want on a sheet of paper, then sit back and wait for the dishes to arrive in whatever order the kitchen make them.

The Dim Sum was the star of the show, loads of little dumplings still sat in their steaming baskets, alongside the steamed buns. Delicious.

I was a bit disappointed in the triple Roast Meats, however, I've definitely had both better and bigger portions in Chinatown. But still perfectly serviceable.

Overall, a very enjoyable meal out, we'll try not to leave it another two years before we go back! Exactly what I hoped for craving some good Chinese food. Lots of vegan & gluten free options. Fast service. Good size portions. So yummy. Friendly funny staff. Would recommend for sure, especially if you’re vegan or gluten free. I recently visited Chung Ying in Birmingham and was pleasantly surprised by how well they cater to vegetarians—especially when it comes to dim sum. As someone who often finds veggie options to be a bit of an afterthought at Chinese restaurants, Chung Ying was a refreshing exception.

Their vegetarian dim sum menu is genuinely thoughtful, not just the usual spring rolls and tofu. The standout for me was the vegetable cheung fun—silky rice noodle rolls filled with perfectly seasoned mushrooms and greens, drizzled with a sweet soy sauce that tied everything together beautifully. The vegetarian siu mai and spinach dumplings were also excellent: delicate, flavorful, and clearly made with care.

What I appreciated most was that nothing felt like a compromise. Every dish was well-balanced and satisfying, with textures and flavors that made each bite interesting. Even the dipping sauces were spot on, complementing the dishes rather than overpowering them.

The setting is classic and bustling, which adds to the charm, and the staff were friendly and helpful when I asked about which dim sum were vegan vs vegetarian.

If you're vegetarian and love dim sum—or have felt left out at traditional dim sum spots—Chung Ying is absolutely worth a visit.",1.0,0.0,"[""Chinese"", ""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Dessert"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Dietary Options"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['sum', 'vegetarian', 'pork', 'alongside', 'vegan', 'dumplings', 'rolls', 'noodles', 'gluten free', 'soup']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""alongside"", ""Dessert"", ""Dietary Options"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""vegan"", ""noodles"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Waiting Time"", ""sum"", ""Portion Size"", ""Cleanliness"", ""rolls"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""pork"", ""soup"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Chinese"", ""vegetarian"", ""gluten free"", ""Burger"", ""Experience"", ""dumplings""]"

I'm always a little disappointed that every beer is served so cold as it subdues the flavour in a lot of them, nevertheless I enjoyed the three beers I had and they were competitively priced on the whole.

Was right for time so also ate here for the first time.

Burger was excellent, really enjoyed it. Fries were meh, but filled a hole.

Massive shout-out to Bhush. Fantastic service, great banter and a sense of humour too. He made the experience better on all levels.

Yet another venue where they ask for a service charge (tip) before food arrives. What if it's terrible? I just don't like this concept. I paid it in advance, on the back of Bhush being great. Luckily the doors was also good, but I just don't like the concept. Visited on a Sunday for a couple of beers after lunch nearby. The service was tremendous, I didn't catch the chap's name but he had a Scottish accent. Very welcoming and friendly.

Beers were decent as expected, but seemed a little on the pricey side. North of £6 for ¾ pints, you can get some of their own beers a lot cheaper in other pubs.

I opted for the Double Hazy IPA at first, and a Raspberry Lemonade for my wife. Then went back up for a Pinball DIPA but sadly they ran out mid-pour and I settled for an Elvis Juice Grapefruit IPA instead.

The vibe inside was nice and chilled at that time, they had board games available, and some people were having lunch, but I didn't try any food myself. Beer tasting experience, taught by Emma and it was excellent 👌.

I had a Steak pie with a red wine sauce, french fries with a cheese topping and gravy. The pie crust was a little hard but tasted great. The sticky toffee pudding with custard was so nice, really could have eaten another one.

I was served by Roo who was friendly and attentive. The food couldn't be faulted. Lovely heartwarming dishes with great flavour, the taste was so fresh, really lovely.
The only thing I would say is that the atmosphere was strange, there was no music, we were one of 5 tables in a small place but it was so quiet and as people left we felt so awkward just having a conversation. Even with 5 tables there was no buzzing chit chat it just felt so cold and hostile, which is such a shame for a place with good food in a stunning location.
There were great vegan options available which was also a win!
I would recommend this place for the food 100%. Visited for lunch and booked beforehand. Food was great. I went for the Moolin Rouge Mothership after deliberating over whether to go for Steak and Ale. Value was decent for where it's located, and service was superb.

A young lady by the name of Chloe was handling the front of shop by herself. We could tell we were coming in at the aftermath of a very busy lunch period. She was very busy tidying, and still served us and others very politely and attentively, and answered all of our questions with ease.

I had the lamb shank roast (with an extra Yorkie!) and my wife had the beef roast. Both meats were cooked to perfection. The lamb fell off the bone and the beef was still slightly pink in the middle. The raspberry sorbet was great and the mousse lived up to expectations. The only criticism is that the roast potatoes lacked any crispiness but the veg was superbly cooked. Service was great but to be expected when paying over £25 each. Can't say it exceeded our expectations but it didn't disappoint, either. Would definitely visit again next time we're in Birmingham. First time attending Chapter for birthday celebrations after hearing good things and it did not disappoint!

Upon arrival, we were greeted and decided to have a drink at the bar. From there, you can sample the great selection of drinks and see the open kitchen with chefs preparing the food to a high standard. It was also a good opportunity to get a view of the dishes available, which all looked amazing and helped us decide on what to go for.

After finishing our drinks, we were seated and ordered our starters. The pork belly starter was absolutely amazing and melted in your mouth. The flavour and quality was outstanding and I can still remember the great taste. Moving onto mains, I went for the lamb, which again did not disappoint. We all ordered different mains, so there was a wide range on the table, which was visually stunning.

I could not fault anything during my time here, the staff also went the extra mile and presented me with a birthday desert at the end which was very kind of them and added that final touch to my birthday dinner.

This is fine dining to high standard, and I would recommend to anyone looking for a special place for the right occasion. I look forward to returning here and would recommend it to all.

Thank you to all the staff members who were brilliant. Keep up the great work standards and food quality. I am looking forward to my next visit. I was shocked 😳
I had soup of the day,and it was tiny.Smallest as ever seen,I tried this dish in 32 countries and every where hot soup is serving with ciabatta or flatbread and butter and sometimes with croutons,in a mug or bowl (and a price is maximum 5-6£)but…it was smallish cup without nothing,and spoon I had after 5 min.,I asked staff about bread as usually (and it is in menu)but a guy said that I can buy it separately .This tiny cup cost 7£.I finished my studying and hungry wanted to find hot food.Not many people can afford this prices,in cafe where you want to find a food - so small portions,my friends not once told me that about Chapter but I wanted to try.I go out hungry and angry.I saw how guy served another people with tiny deserts and starters.
Please change this cup for bowl and put for this 7£ piece of ciabatta,because it is a serving for soup.All lounges serve big bowl of soup with ciabatta and butter for 5£,and it is tasty and healthy.

I had an incredible dining experience at Three Church Road Restaurant. The food was absolutely amazing—each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavour. The quality of the ingredients and attention to detail truly stood out, making every bite a delight.

The service was exceptional, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere from start to finish. A special mention to Vinny, who was brilliant—attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making our meal even more enjoyable. His recommendations were spot on, and his professionalism added to the overall experience.

The only minor downside is that parking at the location can be a bit tricky. However, there’s plenty of parking nearby, so it’s not a major issue.

Overall, Three Church Road is a fantastic place for a meal, whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just enjoying a great night out. Highly recommended! It's been a long time since I did my last review, but I had to break the pattern because the experience in this restaurant was quite amazing - specially because of the outstanding service provided by Sónia(?). She was very thoughtful and caring the whole time, and it instantly made us feel at home. The food is also quite nice and the restaurant is located in a very charming neighbourhood; couldn't recommend more. If there's anything bad to say, I would say that the person at the reception could be more welcoming, but I guess the rest of the crew compensated her lack of sympathy. Beautiful venue, set within a retirement village (so a bit confusing when a taxi pulls up to the doors). The Three Church Road restaurant is a bit hard to access - there are main doors with a sign saying the entrance is to the left, and you walk through what I think is the reception to the retirement home? It’s not very clear but we were able to find it without too much hassle.

The restaurant/bar is very beautifully designed, with lots of different rooms and areas to keep it feeling intimate and private, rather than everyone packed in one big room. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and made it a lovely occasion.

We’d come for the afternoon tea, which seems to be good value at £19.95 but was rather disappointing - largely due to the pretty boring sandwich flavours (tuna, ham & mustard, cheddar & chutney, and chicken tandoori) and the fillings were absolutely tiny - I don’t think I tasted any tuna. The staff were great in tailoring the food to dietary requirements, for vegans, gluten free, and generally fussy people who just wanted an entire plate of ham sandwiches! It was just sad they’d not opted for things such as smoked salmon and cream cheese, egg and cress, and cucumber sandwiches.

And the finger sandwiches came heaped in butter - a white margarine spreadable type thing. Sad. There were scones with individual pots of cream and jam, and a range of cakes though I found these to be quite dry.

Particularly with the sandwiches there felt like a lot of cost-cutting had been going on, and you could barely taste any of the fillings. You can pay £5 extra to enjoy Champagne with your afternoon tea, or gin & tonics.

Despite my disappointment with the food, it looked beautiful and was a lovely thing to do with friends, and we were very well looked after by the staff. Beautiful little restaurant hidden away inside a hotel with intriguing secrets like an ""owners' library"" you can't enter 🤣 The food is exquisite and the price is perfect. £75 for three courses and drinks for two people. Totally recommended. This place is absolutely amazing. Five of us went to celebrate my 50th birthday. The food was exquisite of a very high quality. Our  servers were attentive. Our every need was met. We were not rushed, and my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon and we will definitely be back.",1.0,0.0,"[""Indian"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Seafood""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Special Occasion""]","['church', 'road', 'sandwiches', 'retirement', 'ham', 'tuna', 'exquisite', 'afternoon', 'fillings', 'afternoon tea']","[""afternoon"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""ham"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""church"", ""afternoon tea"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""Cafe"", ""retirement"", ""road"", ""Vegetarian/Vegan"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Seafood"", ""fillings"", ""Fast Food"", ""sandwiches"", ""exquisite"", ""tuna"", ""Indian"", ""Special Occasion"", ""Value"", ""Experience""]"

Every single person is friendly and takes a little time out, to chat with the customer while the order is being prepared.

My kids love coming here too, because of that. The food and drinks are always prepared with care and any problems...it's solved!

This Costa has recently been refurbished and so, it's even better! shocking service , workers messing around , joking with friends ignoring customers having to wait long leaving a huge queue for customers. drinks served 10minutes later and toast was cold. Gave me my drink half empty , had to ask her to fill it. as you can see in the picture my drink was flooding and didn’t even add toppings as labelled in menu. Didn’t mix my drink properly My favourite Costa Coffee in Birmingham. Staff always lovely and kind. Nice open space place. It can get really crowded during the weekend but it's everywhere you go.
Since they have done the refurbishment it feels more uncomfortable. Ignore the times largely given by Google they are the Next closing times and Costa has to close 30 minutes before the store.

Sadly I fear they are going to ruin this one as well as it is due a ""makeover"" in March. We visited this coffee shop and thoroughly enjoyed the experience with yummy food and drinks - highly recommend Costa.  The atmosphere was nice but would have preferred a more secluded area.

Awesome location and the best so far in Birmingham for a drink or dine. The view of canal from here is beautiful and definitely will be amazing in summer.
It’s a Green King pub. Choice of local beers as well as other breweries of UK. Staff were friendly. Service was good. Veggie options in dine. Very nice and cool atmosphere. Didn’t realised they have balcony until i was out. Next time i’lll be there for the best view. Stopped in The Malt House for dinner due to it's convenience. We waited for a little bit before we found that we had to scan the QR code to order.  While this made the ordering fairly easy, it prevented us from being able to ask a waiter/waitress about the  foods and drinks.  It also made it a little painful when we wanted to add another drink.  Outside of those challenges it was a nice place and the steak and ale pie was excellent.  Now that I know the ordering process, I would go there again. An ideal location on the canals, and have to be honest and say service is poor, I felt we were doing the staff a favour by ordering drinks, we got a white wine and had to ask for an ice bucket, the roof terrace is closed on a beautiful day. A party of 6 now moving on to a different bar because of  the staff. Greeted with smiles when we walked in ans served straight away.

New cloth on the benches and new chairs. Very impressed they have revamped the place. Guinness is still very good from here. Will give it 4 stars now as I didn't try the food but pub is clean and staff excellent

A decent pint of Guinness and ok service let down by sub par food and general cleanliness of the places (see photos). Food was ok nothing great not really worth the price you pay. Was given a dirty knife(see photos) basic requirement would be to at least give clean cutlery. The place needs a serious revamp starting to look run down. Benches got plenty of stains and not been cleaned properly. Would probably not return here however the pint of Guinness was pretty decent so that was a plus. First time in the area, so I called in as have always loved 'proper' pubs. It didn't disappoint. Bar staff were great, and we had a great time. Not sure on food, but there were plenty eating and it looked good. 4 stars only because I think £25 for 4 pints is expensive, that said, I am from Yorkshire. Definitely worth a visit. Nice enough pub in the Jewellery Quarter, quite busy on a Saturday afternoon,  however seats were available. No cask conditioned ale but they have Brixton and Beavertown pale ale on keg.

Had a chocolate chip cookie which was average.

Also ordered a Nutella cookie dough with ice cream. Nice but think the presentation could be better.

No organisation with people waiting for their order.

Overall, my rating is average. love this place amazing customer service especially from Bismah, she was so sweet and quick with our food will definitely be coming back Hate that they don’t warm up normal cookies, so disappointing but they taste okay. I got pistachio and milk chocolate DELICIOUS! Best desserts place ever!!!

Everything is delicious there. I tried the Oreo stack, Kinder Bueno stack, Lotus stack, S****y brownie stack, Oreo milkshake, and Lotus milkshake and they ALL taste like heaven. Really disappointed. Paid ~£7 for some overly sweet cookie dough with cream cheese and biscoff spread slathered over it. Sounds better than it tasted.

The kitchen area looked really dirty, with a cardboard box full of squares of frozen cookie dough sitting open on the counter. All the staff had dirty aprons and I had to wait 10mins for them to heat one of these chunks of dough.

The portion was way too big for me and I felt like I was going to throw up after eating half of it (might be partially my fault for attempting to eat it myself).

Really wanted to like this place, cookie dough is usually really tasty but this was far from the real thing.

Great quality and massive portions with an extensive menu (with pictures on the menu which is fab). This place is the best for sharing dishes as they provide small side plates. Note that this place is cash only but there is a cash point opposite the gay village under 1 minute walk down the road (can't miss it). Adjacent to the Dragon Inn wetherspoons, which is a great little combo in China town near the Hippodrome. Service is good and usually quick. Great for any meat and prawns, noodles or rice dishes - for a classic british chinese experience as well as some more authentic traditional options like skewers and hot pots/ tentacles, etc. Food was really nice. I’d give the chicken Choi Mein a 7/10- it did come a bit cold and the chicken was a bit too salty for me but I really did enjoy it. The pork mini dumpling buns were 10/10. The broth inside was so nice I had seconds so soft and hot. The sizzling beef my friend had and it was a solid 9/10, it was hot and fresh and tasty. The lady behind the bar was so lovely we tipped her and the gentlemen who served us were also really nice. They kept refilling the vinegar soy sauce and chilli oil that was on the table. Overall a solid 8.5/10 experience! I’ve been a fairly regular customer there, and today, as always, I was very happy with the service provided by May.

However, at the end, I was charged £11 for a sweet and sour soup, even though the menu listed it at £4.50. It’s not a big deal to me, but nobody likes to be cheated. Because of this, I’m not sure if I’ll return while the same man is still working there. Lovely little place, great food and reasonably priced. Great menu, lots to choose from. The only thing is no matter whether they are busy or not there is inconsistent service, depending on who serves you, whether they are polite or abrupt and well mannered or not.
Service can be really slow and take ages to be served or food comes out before drinks. Nevertheless, we enjoy the food we keep coming back. Cash only. Great restaurant!

The service was also excellent! The staff was friendly, efficient, and made sure my order was prepared with care. The atmosphere of the place was cozy and inviting, making it a great spot to enjoy a high-quality drink. I will definitely be coming back for more! Highly recommended! Been going to this place for a long time now and I can say it’s one of the best places for beverages especially ice cold drinks. My favourite is the iced pistachio latte it’s so nice and creamy the perfect amount of sweetness. Every time I go into town I always have to stop by fruit and ice for an ice coffee. The staff are so arrogant and look like they've never smiled a day in their life. You'd think they were held against their will and take it out on customers. Drinks are good but sometimes they forget to add syrups and flavours. Train the staff please to do better Tried fruit and ice foe the first time and their matcha was definitely good. It doesn't taste of 'grass' as other places we have tried and it had a good flavour to it. If you love croissants then they do sweet and savoury! I tried the pistachio and chicken tikka and both tasted good We ordered a chocolate milk shake and a cherry poppins smoothie to enjoy in the sunshine. Made quickly in front of us. Friendly staff.

There’s the option to eat outside; we were taken to a very beautiful indoor room.
The menu is very rich and varied, with dishes for vegetarians and vegans. The drinks are good.

The only downside was the staff, who were completely inattentive to the customers. They were certainly polite, but I had to struggle several times to get their attention. We stopped by Damascena Coffee House for breakfast before my train, and it was the perfect way to end my trip. The atmosphere was warm and homely — so calming and welcoming. We had the shakshuka and ijjeh omelette, along with a chai latte and karak chai — everything was absolutely delicious. Hamza’s service was amazing and added such a lovely touch to the whole experience. I left feeling full, comforted, and grateful. Can’t recommend it enough. I had been to this coffee shop a while ago for lunch & liked it, but came again years later for breakfast now (it seems the menu spans both meals). The food is still lovely and our waiter Hamza was helpful - not too pushy when we needed longer with the menu, but still attentive enough to check up on us.

The courtyard feel with the tree in the middle adds to the thoughtful atmosphere. The only thing is that the music can be a little loud (especially for early morning!)

Fast service. Definitely recommend the coffee, really good quality coffee beans great taste, much better than high street coffee shop chains!

The true gem of this venue is the staff, the welcoming locals and the brilliantly priced food served by Liz in the kitchen.

Beers cheap and delicious food. We’re back again next week this time booking direct. We have even requested a plated Sunday dinner from the Sunday lunch menu for tea Monday evening.

Nothing is to much trouble here and Tj and his staff are fantastic . Il be bringing my snooker Que to give the locals a game and also enjoy watching  some football on sky sports

Don’t take to much notice of reviews come and try and the place you won’t be disappointed

Only down side is mainly Birmingham fc fans 🤣🤣 but fantastic banter When we first arrived at the avenue and lodge they said they weren't serving food on Friday and Saturday it says nothing at all on the website about not serving food . Then when we got the key for room 4 it was disgusting and terrible the door handle was holding on by a screw , there was stains on the carpet , the shower cubicle had black mould inside which made me not want to wash the shower head wouldn't stop dripping , there was mould on the bathroom ceiling , holes in the bathroom walls and mould on one of the blinds and the room was not value for the amount I paid.

When I tried to ring up and say if they could help me sort the situation they hung the phone up on me I dont recommend this place at all . Didn't stay at the hotel,  we were a visi
ting team as part of a snooker tournament's.
The bar staff and Steward were very friendly,  helpful and happy to help. The piat match buffet was sausages, chips, curry sauce and two rounds of bread. What's not to like?
Oh, by the way, we won 4:1. 🏆 I have never stopped overnight at the Avenue and lodge, so this is why I have not rated that part,  but I have had a meal and a drink there. We held my sisters wake there last year and their catering was really good. I have also eaten Sunday lunch there and the food is excellent there. The staff are very nice and always helpful.

The service & cleanliness were excellent.
The warmth & friendliness was so welcoming & relaxing.
The drinks were very good quality.
We were having a little stop off to have a drink & use the toilet.
We were really happy that we chose to go there. We totally recommend it!!! Disappointing flat white. Popped in for a coffee as it says coffee house on the front sign. Ordered a flat white at £3.30, a bit cheaper than most indy places and the menu looked reasonable and well priced but I just wanted some coffee. Ordered a flat white and served quickly but the cup was HOT, I then went to add some sweetener and when I took the lid off the milk was way too frothy for a flat white (or even for a cappuccino). I waited 5-10 mins for it to get to a drinkable temperature and it just tasted burnt. Both the espresso and the milk and the texture wasn't what I'd expect at all. Similar milk texture to a Greggs flat white but at least Greggs espresso isn't burnt.

I binned the entire coffee which I hate doing. I'll always try and force myself to drink something I've paid for but it was just bitter. Got a coffee at another nearby spot and there was a world of difference in the care for the process and the final drink.

It was very clean and chill in the cafe and I didn't try anything else so it's a middle of the road 3 stars from me. Unfortunately, quite average. The place is clean and nice looking. Their drink menu is nothing you can’t find elsewhere and it was just good, nothing more. Also the fact that they do Redbul ads doesn’t give much independent coffee vibes. It seems like a good place for people who wants to work or sit and read. I have never left a bad Google review.
This coffee shop charged 80p extra for oat milk - making the coffee £4.10 - which is rare outside of London.
It was a long wait for the coffee.
But, the reason for the bad review, the coffee was absolutely awful. Actually, undrinkable. It had a taste of bbq sauce. It went in the bin. Had the Summer Fruit Smoothie and the Green Juice, tastes really good, my new favorite to go place. Small menu but done with quality in mind. Price is good as well.

This was an afternoon gift and was a nightmare to make contact as the holiday staff when I phoned  had no idea where the Lobby was so no help there. The booking was confirmed hours before we were due to arrive and hey ho part of the Holiday Inn!!!
The most soulless place as guess we were accommodated at the last minute , even though booked weeks ahead.
To top it all we were denied a doggy bag (company policy) as no food allowed to be taken off the premises.
We  wrapped the left overs, departed and 3 homeless were very appreciative. With a bit of work, this could be a great quiet but cheeky cocktail spot. The maple Old Fashioned was saved from being too sweet by my barman asking ""strong or sweet"" - latter means a bit more booze........too much ice also.

Couldn't find the front door, so I went into holiday Inn next door to ask for directions, only to find I was there.

Only people we witnessed were people checking in and out of the hotel.

We were a little early for opening but the lady was kind enough to let us sit and wait inside.
It was good that we went in when quiet as we got to explore the art on the walls which is very eclectic and makes for good viewing. There's plenty of space inside and out.
Parking is found on the side road or in the back but parking in the back is limited.
Food you could order through the QR code on the tables or at the counter and we did both as some of the party weren't comfortable with technology like that and they also wanted to adjust the order.
There was a little delay to my food but all due respect to our server, who came to advise that there was a small error in preparing it and it would take just a little longer. The update was really appreciated.
Food came and it was tasty! Drinks were nice too.
All in all a good place to visit but for a cafe I did find the prices a little expensive for what you get. But the service and food can't be knocked.
Enjoy your visit here. Such a cute atmosphere and lovely place with good vibes! Food was delicious and the coffee was amazing too, served by friendly and welcoming staff who were eager to help you. Would definitely come back here and recommend to anyone! Thank you so much:) Really great brunch place! I had the Sweetcorn hash, which was delicious!

Also the airconditioner can sometimes be too strong and the draft feels a bit much. Other than that the place is great, with great views out the windows and comfy chairs. Friendly staff asked how I was doing and gave me some free porridge. Filter coffee for £1.20 is great value I was served by one of the lovely staff this afternoon, forgot to ask his name unfortunately but will try to find out and update when I can.

I came in earlier wondering which of the new flavoured iced lattes to try – ended up going with the Ube Brûlée one, and he very kindly gave me a discount as I was trying it for the first time. Also asked about a certain sandwich which looked like it was out of stock, but they had just made a fresh batch so I was able to get one. So fresh that the bread was still warm!

I live nearby and I’m surprised I’ve only just visited for the first time, but will definitely be back for some more working sessions and to try some of the other summer drinks and matchas – I didn’t realise the inside was so big. Plenty of seating and quite a few tables that have plugs for both regular chargers and USB types.

10/10 for the wonderful service, really made such a difference for me! Popped in this morning for some coffee and breakfast.
It's a small store, so it's not loads to choose from, but the pastries were fresh and yoghurt pots tasty.
Lots of seating upstairs, code for the toilet on the receipt.
We enjoyed people watching out of the window. Went to this place ....
The staff there told me I could only stay for 30min
No reason why,
Just said to me it was a time limit
The cafe was pretty much empty, only three customers with me
The time limit made me feel unwelcome and not really wanting to go back again 😞

Firstly, they had no still water, then the carbonated water was warm, which wasn't very nice on such a hot day. I got my food and got on the train. I couldn't eat all of the food as it was very warm and the type of food they sell needs to be in a fridge. I had not ended my journey when I vomited the food back up. It was very embarrassing on the train. I was so disappointed and would not recommend it, or if you do go, check the fridges are working
I did not sit in, I had takeaway, so I can not say what eating on the site is like. This review is for the Birmingham New Street station
Extremely disappointing and costly Perfect for a quick bite before catching the train. It’s a bit hectic since it’s inside the station, but it’s fine — and the food’s pretty good too. This was a surprise to us. Not far from platform exits. It's a self-service like any place.  Takes the items to the counter, pay for your items, and then either sit down and eat, or take it away.
We could've taken with us to the train, but we had so much time we just ate onsite.
Restaurant pleasant, nothing to really jabber about. It is clean and we could eat our food there.
The food was hot, so if you are heading for a long journey, I would recommend getting a takeaway from Wasabi and taking it to the train. Sometimes you do need something substantial and hot. That said, there were plenty of sushi choices available.
Definitely will be back. Best place to pick up sushi if your in a rush or don't want to wait ages to be served or just in general as the Food is always fresh and tastes amazing. I eat here often and never have any complaints. Location is always super clean and staff are always welcoming 🍣😋💞 prices are great for what you get. Well place on the ground floor of grand Central mall,  and in between the two ticket gantries and platform entrances.

This fast food Japanese restaurant serves take away and dine in.  The place is spacious and not crammed.
Prices are reasonable.  They serve sushi bentos, noodle, snacks and drinks.

A great pub, dog and family friendly. We've been a few times for family catch-ups and it's always been a great atmosphere, spotless loos and very reasonably priced. Always impressed with the staff here, but last time Lauren went above and beyond to make sure we had a good experience. It's servers like her that keep customers coming back to a place.

The food was absolutely delicious every dish was beautifully presented and full of flavour. The service was seamless, and our server made sure everything was perfect without ever feeling rushed.

A huge thank you to the entire team for making my birthday so memorable. It’s rare to find a place that gets both the food and the atmosphere just right, but you all nailed it. I’ll definitely be back and recommending you to friends and family! As you walked in the place had the look and feel of a high quality restaurant. The atmosphere was very pleasant and felt like it had a touch of quality. Good menu choices, although not much variety with the vegetarian options. Wine list was good. Definitely highly recommend for anyone who likes Italian food. Very good birthday experience here and staff are all friendly. Erion and Anna sung a birthday song for me, thank you all so much:)) My favorite one is half lobster pasta and I will definitely go back next time😍 I come to Birmingham for work every couple of months and know I will always get the best food, service and experience at this Piccolino’s.

I always go back to them despite trying other places!!! Also, i love their creativity and always look forward for their new stuff Located in the heart of a busy street and market. I always wondered why such a long queue and because of the queue never tried going inside, until today.
Nice options for coffee. Sitting available both inside and outside, with tables for 2 or more. There is a weird plantation inside, acting as a divider between the continuous sofa type sitting, but is a huge waste of space. Interior designing mistake?
The popular item here is ""White chocolate matcha"", you can get it in hot and cold (iced) versions. A kind of attraction of this place, as everyone can be seen a cup with green liquid. Worth it! Most of the drinks are available in small and large cup options.
It says skip the queue, order using App, we tried but the app wasn't working to take orders. Though you can scroll the menu in the app while in the queue, so installing it was not a total waste.
The staff is good and helpful. The guy (from India, sorry didn't catch your name) was very nice. He recommended us items for the next time. Looking forward to visiting more.
Nice environment overall. Ideal place for a quick coffee and cookie. That's why it is always full! I bought 3 pieces of vegan banana loafs. I had a take away order. As I reached home to have the vegan banana loaf, there was hair in the vegan banana loaf. 2ndly the vegan ones are touching the other non vegan food. Due to allergy or non allergies it should be kept separately. I had an extremely great experience at Blank Street Birmingham , particularly at the New street branch. The service from staff was incredible and i would like to honourably mention a particular staff member, Nacime , who made the experience pleasant for us. His friendly attitude and enthusiastic demeanour made us feel so welcome. Because of him and his customer service, I have come to this blank street more and more and will continue to do so. Thank you Nacime!!! I grabbed a coffee on the go ☕️ from Blank Street. My Mocha was good (although I prefer Oatly Barista, so I had to go with normal milk).
I'm impressed, I'll be back (God willing).
Now, the surprise was the pastries! 😍👌🏽
I'd just come from a booji cake shop just down the street, but this place for the win!
I'll post more pics next time.

Update:

The first time I bought an almond croissant, it was great. The next 2/3 times, it was kinda dry and a bit  burnt (see pic). 🫤 Perhaps I'll leave it for a while.

Atmosphere:
Rooftop restaurant, atmosphere is nice and good songs played throughout the dinner. View is pleasant but charged £5 per person for a window seat (came to an extra £10). There is a bar section that plays different songs but this does not interfere with the dining area, seems to be quite lively with people even dancing. There is a smoking area that provides an amazing view too.

Food:
Halal steaks are available if you require this but it is only the fillets. Do not order the calamari below, it is extremely chewy, the batter is stale, the sauce has a weird test (I would rate this 0/10). Steaks are nicely cooked and the peppercorn sauce is good too, mushrooms had a bitter taste, spinach is okay but not reasoned well. Ordered a side of chips and onion rings to share, onion rings are huge and I ordinarily like this style but they were extremely oily, to the point it becomes uncomfortable to eat. Chips were thick cut but also very oily, I would not recommend either of the sides. The only nice thing ordered was the steak.

Service:
Service was professional but we had to call someone over to order which usually does not happen as waiters come over. We also had to wait a while to pay once the bill was received. Other than that the waiters were very nice. I had a lovely afternoon out! The food was delicious, especially the liver pâté which was outstanding. Our drinks were regularly topped up during the bottomless brunch, and the service was spot on thanks to a brilliant waitress, even though I didn't catch her name. The atmosphere was great, but there were a few cleanliness issues in the toilets. Despite that, I'll definitely be back! I had a fantastic meal recently and the service was exceptional. The crispy calamari with tartar sauce was delicious, and the fillet steak was cooked to perfection. Although I wasn’t offered a second drink during the meal, the atmosphere was still enjoyable. Just a heads up, it would be great if the voucher details were clearer when booking! Overall, a lovely dining experience and I’d definitely recommend it. We had a voucher for afternoon tea. Lovely atmosphere, paid £5 extra for seat by the window for the view.

Staff are very friendly and we were served quickly. Scone was delicious (1 jam between 2) but everything else pretty average. Grateful for the voucher but wouldn’t come again. I have to say based on the service and the cleanliness of the restaurant I was a little let down. The food was sub-par and although the waitress was a wonderful sweet young woman she clearly was new and was thrown into the deep end without any real training, not her fault at all. The cutlery had to be exchanged because of a dirty set that was on the table and the glasses had spots on them. The staff and the atmosphere was the highlight of the outing and to be fair for around 50 pounds/person (Including wine) the steak deal was not terrible. However, my sirloin had quite a bit more fat than I would have liked. We went for a friend’s birthday and the tiny corner sliver of brownie (which was comped) was laughable. We decided to get another bottle of wine and enjoy the sunset on the terrace which did provide fantastic 360 views.",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Dessert"", ""Steakhouse""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Dietary Options"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Special Occasion""]","['voucher', 'view', 'steak', 'atmosphere', 'rooftop', 'steaks', 'oily', 'songs', 'rings', 'onion rings']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""rooftop"", ""Steakhouse"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""steaks"", ""Dessert"", ""Dietary Options"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""steak"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""rings"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""view"", ""atmosphere"", ""voucher"", ""onion rings"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Fast Food"", ""songs"", ""Special Occasion"", ""Value"", ""Experience"", ""oily""]"

I had a truly wonderful experience at Starbucks today, all thanks to  Andrea. From the moment I walked in, she  greeted me with a warm smile and made me feel genuinely welcomed. Her attention to detail, friendly attitude, and professionalism stood out immediately.

She not only got my order perfectly right but also went the extra mile to ensure everything was just how I liked it. In a fast-paced environment, it’s rare to see someone treat every customer with such patience, care, and kindness.

People like her who turn a regular coffee run into a memorable experience. Thank you for your outstanding service — you truly made my day! ☕💚 I just had the best Java Chip Frap of thanks to an absolute star at Starbucks! Jessie made the drink perfectly! Jessie was so friendly, warm and full of good energy. Jessie took the time to chat, made sure everything was just right, and you could really see the effort they put in. It’s rare to come across someone who brightens your day like that — I left with a smile and a very nice drink! Abysmal product. I expected overinflated prices, however, considering they used the justification of the drink being a ‘promotional’ product and that it’s a franchise, you think they’d put the effort into making it look like a ‘promotional’ product. There’s no cold foam,  and it looked like a rush job when there wasn’t even a queue. London Euston on a busy day with train cancellations can make a correct drink. At least it was quick ⸻

🌟 Outstanding Service at Starbucks! 🌟

I had such a lovely experience thanks to one of your amazing team members! The staff( Sophia)  was incredibly friendly, professional, and attentive—they truly made my visit special. They greeted me with a warm smile, took the time to get my order just right, and even remembered my name and usual drink!

It’s the little things that make a big difference, and their positive attitude and genuine care for customers really stood out. In a busy world, it’s refreshing to meet someone who takes pride in their work and brings joy to others.

Thank you for the great coffee and even better service! Can’t wait to come back. ☕💚 Just wanted to do a big shout out for Jessie who, despite being super busy, was doing it all with a massive smile and going out of her way to make every customer feel appreciated.

My favourite restaurant for Thai cuisine, every dish is packed full of flavour and the variety is superb for vegetarians too. An extentive drinks menu too. Our food was served super quick which was perfect as were famished! Jan was very pleasant and attentive. She even took some really nice photos for us, 10/10 for your customer service, Thank you for a fab experience. Ok, where do I start… I wouldn’t say this was a horrible meal, there were definitely some nice elements, but I also can’t say I’d ever return. The price and quality just don’t match.

We started with the seafood platter, which overall was decent. The sauces were the highlight and added a lot of flavour, but the shrimp was slightly overcooked and the scallops were a bit rubbery. Still, the sauces made up for it.

For the main, I went for the hot platter, which was quite underwhelming. There was barely any beef - mostly just a lot of vegetables. It was very spicy, which I don’t mind, but the overall flavour was just average. Honestly, your local Chinese takeaway could serve up more flavour. The rice was also just plain and nothing special.

The one thing that really stood out was the mocktail – it was excellent. Other than that, the meal didn’t leave a lasting impression, and I wouldn’t recommend it based on this experience.

For over £50 per person, you can definitely find a better place to dine. The food just didn’t taste authentic, local, or like the homemade-style Thai food you’d expect. I went there with a couple of friends and we had such a great time! Alex, who looked after our table, was super nice and really took great care of us. The service was awesome. The food was delicious, and the drinks were just as good. I had the nonocolada that Mo made—it was amazing! Mo was also really sweet and friendly to us. When it comes to Thai cuisine, this place truly stands out. I’ve explored many Thai restaurants across Birmingham, but this one remains my absolute favourite. The dishes are packed with rich flavours and spices—from starters to mains and even desserts, there’s something to satisfy every palate. The staff are incredibly friendly, welcoming, and attentive, and the service is always prompt. While Birmingham boasts many great Thai spots, the branches in Harborne and Shirley are my top picks. That said, the service and staff are consistently excellent at all their locations. The food was very tasty, especially the sticky mango rice.

I visited McDonald's last Saturday and had the best ever welcome from a staff member at the drive-thru. As soon as I pulled up, she greeted me with a warm, cheerful ""Good afternoon, welcome to McDonald’s, may I take your order?"" – and I could genuinely tell she was happy to help.

Her polite and positive attitude made the entire experience truly wonderful. It's rare these days to come across such sincere customer service, and it really made my day. Kudos to her and to McDonald’s for having such a great team member! I recently had an unpleasant experience at the McDonald's drive-through. I ordered a Crispy McChicken meal, and upon taking a bite, I found a hair about 7 inches long in the burger with meat stuck to it. It was absolutely gut-wrenching to realize a slimy hair was in my mouth. 😢

I immediately called McDonald's and spoke to Christos, who kindly offered a replacement meal. While I appreciate the offer, it's really not enough to make up for the horrible experience. This has seriously affected my trust in the food's hygiene and quality.

Hoping McDonald's can take serious steps to prevent this from happening to other customers in the future. Safe food handling should always be a top priority. We payed for ketchup yet we didn’t get any and in the fish fillet there was hair. The hygiene is insanely poor and can put someone off food for a while. Expected better. A month ago, ordered a McMuffin as usual. It came with adult size sausage, egg and one size of bread but with another bread in kid size. I requested to change it to get a normal size bread so that both sizes are matched. Finally it’s ridiculously that they gave me another kid size egg and bread to match with the original kid size bread. I’m explored and just made a refund.

Excellent value for a taster menu.

Can't comment about the hotel because didn't stay.
Highly recommended and I'm sure we will return. From the moment we stepped into Baloci Hotel in Birmingham, we knew we were in for something truly special. Themed rooms add a unique charm to this exquisite stay, and we had the pleasure of experiencing the Persian Room—a stunning blend of elegance and comfort.

The bed was nothing short of heavenly—sumptuously soft yet perfectly supportive, inviting us into restful nights wrapped in opulence. Every detail of the room’s presentation reflected an impeccable eye for beauty, from the intricate decor to the perfectly curated ambiance that transported us into a world of Persian luxury.

One of the highlights of our stay was the deep bathtub—an absolute haven for relaxation. Its generous size and indulgent depth made for the perfect escape after a day out, allowing us to sink into tranquility with ease.

Dining at Baloci was a remarkable experience in itself. We opted for the Michelin-starred taster menu, and every bite was an exquisite celebration of flavor. Each dish was beautifully crafted, bursting with creativity and precision, delivering an unforgettable culinary journey.

But above all, the service was extraordinary—indescribably top-class. Every interaction was marked by professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness, making us feel truly valued and at ease throughout our stay.

Baloci Hotel is more than just a place to stay—it is an experience that leaves you mesmerized and rejuvenated. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a luxurious and immersive escape.

Thank you staff, you are all so amazing! A Lovely Anniversary Dinner at Baloci

We recently celebrated our anniversary at Baloci, and the evening turned out to be a delightful experience. The ambience was calm and inviting, creating the perfect setting for a quiet celebration. The staff were friendly, courteous, and attentive, making us feel welcomed from the moment we walked in.

We started our meal with the Joojeh Koftah Kebab, which was presented well but could have been better in terms of flavor. However, the rest of the dishes truly impressed us. The Sultani Lamb Chops were succulent and well-seasoned, and the Kabuli Pulav stood out with its rich aroma and perfectly balanced flavors. Each dish was plated beautifully, adding to the overall dining experience.

To accompany our meal, we tried two drinks—Persian Sage and Persepolis—both of which were refreshing and paired well with the food.

What made the evening even more special was the thoughtful gesture from the staff. Knowing it was our anniversary, they greeted us with a personalized card and a plate of delicious baklava. The baklava was flaky, sweet, and just the right end to our meal.

Overall, Baloci provided us with a memorable evening of good food, warm hospitality, and thoughtful details. had dinner at Baloci Restaurant recently, and it was an amazing experience. From the moment we walked in, the ambiance was cozy and inviting. The food was absolutely delicious—each dish was perfectly cooked, and you could really taste the quality of the ingredients. But what made the evening even better was the service. I have to give a special shout-out to Farah, the receptionist. She was so warm and friendly, making us feel welcome right away. She went above and beyond, offering great recommendations and just making the whole experience feel personal and special. Her hospitality really stood out and made the night even better.

So Bill’s, in terms of the food I’ve definitely had way better food. The atmosphere is chilled and calm and the crowd is decent too.

I ordered the Sea Bass dish with Couscous, because I wanted a healthy option. If I ever visit there again, I’d try something else but I wasn’t the only one in the group that had something negative to say about the food tbh.

Decent food but like I said I’ve had way better food dining in Bull Ring. The Pomegranate drink was okay. Breakfast in brum 🥞☀️☕️

Good morning sun trap with a nice breakfast to follow could of been a 5 but maybe we didn’t make the right choices off the menu, biscoff pancakes was a sweet sensation but the chorizo dish was a bit confused lots going on but never really gelled needed a better dipping sauce for the flatbread. cappuccino was good but the coconut matcha wasn’t great but definitely could taste the 🥥 overall would recommend 🍽️ Bottomless pancakes Friday.

I saw on instagram that they have a bottomless pancakes every Friday, all day, so we went to try.

You can choose only between two different kinds of pancakes, but absolutely deserve the chance to try them.

I had fruit pancakes, they were delicious.
And you can order more when your plate of empty for 90 minutes.

The staff was okay, really busy, so the time for wait the new round take time, (I only had two)

But I understand how busy they were, the restaurant is lovely and you can’t miss the location because is easy to find.

If you have a chance don’t think a lot and go and try them, next time I will go with my girls, so is a great date for have a family breakfast. Won’t be back, we were seated at the back of the restaurant, to be greeted with a sticky table and filthy glasses on the table…. Then we asked for a substitute for one of the items on a breakfast, as didn’t want mushrooms, to be told ‘No’!  Food was ok, my ginger beer didn’t have much flavour.  There’s a lot of choice for places to eat in Birmingham, this place needs to do better, in my view.",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Dessert"", ""Breakfast""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['pancakes', 'breakfast', 'way better', 'try', 'better', 'bottle', 'bottomless', 'said', 'chance', 'friday']","[""bottomless"", ""way better"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""chance"", ""Breakfast"", ""Dessert"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""said"", ""Waiting Time"", ""try"", ""breakfast"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""pancakes"", ""bottle"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Fast Food"", ""better"", ""Value"", ""friday"", ""Experience""]"

If you have a chance you should pay a visit and try it for yourself - a mix of magic and taste. The chef is a true magician and surely will be back for more. Food and service were both excellent. Gladly accommodated my children too which is a bonus because they were very excitable that day Delivery was promised for 30mins, it took 60. Everything was stone cold. I've never had crispy duck in pancakes pre assembled... The pancakes weren't fresh and ripped, tiny tiny amount of mushy duck in each. All getting soggy and lying in a thin watery sauce. Spring rolls were over cooked and broken, again everything in the spring rolls was cooked to some sort of mush. We didn't eat the meal after tasting. I can't believe other reviews are real/honest...

We’ve been a few times now and never had a bad experience. The food is absolutely exceptional, you really can’t fault it. On our most recent visit, I have to give special mention to the cheesecake, whoever tempered the white chocolate did an incredible job. It was delicate, crisp, and beautifully done.

Everyone was friendly and welcoming as always. While the service can sometimes be a little slow or unsure, it’s completely understandable as they’re still learning and you can see the effort they’re putting in.

If you’re in Birmingham, I would 100% recommend giving this place a try!! Arranged a works meal for 20 colleagues, needed regular communication in the lead up as people dropped out, it was no problem.  On arrival we had drinks by very polite bar staff before being shown to our seats.  Everything was laid out immaculately and the food was outstanding.  We had arrancini balls as a pre starter, which really set the expectations high, it was delicious!  Around the table, from the cod, beef, lamb, duck and vegetarian options everyone loved the quality, taste and portion size...even the veg and roasted baby new potatoes were delicious!  The desserts were also stunning in presentation, from mousse, trifle, baked Alaska, many of us were unable to finish as we were so full from previous courses!  The overall costs was under £40 for 3 courses plus drinks - outstanding value for money!  The staff were courteous and attentive and wish them all the best in their careers.  Can't wait to go back! 🤞🙏 Always a great night at the Restaurant with high-quality food, very attentive service from the students who are learning, and amazing value for money for AA Rosette food from the city’s future chefs. The 3-course meal also includes a free snack and a pre-dessert, making it 5 courses plus warm sourdough from their in-house bakery. Highly recommended. We have eaten here lots of times over the last 5 years , great food and a lovely atmosphere with the service staff learning their trade with plenty of enthusiasm, the chefs are well on there way to providing 1st class food at the best restaurants I  have eaten in.

One thing I would say is...... lose the TV screens, it's not a sports bar and they detract from what the experience should be, its a minor thing and shouldn't stop anyone going, there's no sound involved,  it just takes a bit away from a beautiful environment......for me. Found this by chance when walked near the Victoria Town Hall. I saw good review on Google map and never regret with my decision to give a try and the influence of the good reviews.

The lamb is super yummy, when I start eating I was doubting was I ordering a beef steak but it wasn’t, is lamb. I’m very impressed with the texture and the taste of the gravy. Excellent!

The appetisers and snacks are all yummy and served in style.

This is a place where you see the restaurant manager guiding the trainee students and they execute their role up to standard. I’m not sure who is the lady that guiding the trainees but I just very certain she is a great person to take care of the restaurant and the trainees.

Staff were inattentive. Would rather stay at the bar talking to each other than took a while to come over to take our order. The banana katsu desert was lacking flavour and was dry. Always a tasty meal at Wagamamas and this was no exception! The servers were all super friendly and the good came super fast. We will definitely be back. No wait to be seated at Saturday lunchtime which was fantastic. I would like to express my deep disappointment with the service I received during my recent visit to your restaurant.

Upon entering, I was escorted to table number 631 by a waitress and she wrote the name as ‘Tyler’ on the table. After reviewing it, I raised my hand to place an order. A male staff member acknowledged me with a nod, but no one ever came to take my order. I waited patiently for 10 minutes, yet still, no one approached.

Thinking perhaps the restaurant required online ordering, I tried placing an order via your online system. However, I received an error message saying that this table number was not recognized by the system. This was incredibly frustrating and unacceptable.

The service was so poor that I couldn’t tolerate it any longer. It was beyond disappointing—it was outright infuriating. I ended up walking out of the restaurant without anyone on your staff even noticing or acknowledging the situation. I have never experienced such careless, disrespectful, and thoughtless service before.

I sincerely hope you take this matter seriously. I would appreciate a proper explanation, and more importantly, real improvement in your service. Customer service DOES NOT EXIST with Brindley Place Wagamamas.

We waited 25 minutes to be sat down and whilst waiting nobody spoke to us. We were a reserved table of 6 and the waitress ROSIE clearly didn’t care about her job, she was rude and senseless to us.

When we were FINALLY sat down we were placed at a table for 4!!!! Whilst there was an empty table for 6 with nobody sat at it. ROSIE then proceeded to place a couple and a table for four at said table for 6.

This really upset us as ROSIE didn’t even apologise to us and when we asked for another table she simply walked off.

When we spoke to LAUREN the manager we were then told that the couple that were sat AFTER us at said table for 6 were regulars and neither LAUREN or ROSIE apologised to us.

In fact ROSIE persisted to seat other people at 6 seater tables purely out of pettiness until we decided to move ourselves to one.

Nobody came and asked us how our food was and apart from AMRIT who seemed much more with it and helpful, we were treated with cold responses.

I personally don’t see how one cannot count to 6. However, be that as it may, the service that we were given was the worst customer service I have EVER received.

Just basic lack of common sense and people skills. It’s frustrating when we’d made every possible effort to have a nice and enjoyable evening and we’re treated rudely when I’d never treat someone with the same disrespect we were treated with. Came here for a lunchtime catchup with some friends from work. Bearing in mind it was Easter hols at 12pm, the venue was reasonably populated, but not full by any means. Despite there being quite a few staff milling about, there didn't seem to be anyone manning the front of house area (there is one here, otherwise we would have just sat down somewhere). We were seated after a brief delay. And then came the slightly longer delay of getting served. Which we did eventually - and from that point onwards - all was good. The menu piqued interest and the young lady serving us was attentive, friendly and helpful. Even showed us how to pay using the QR code on the table, which was a great idea. I opted for a chicken ramen with a side order of red chillies. My friends had a variety of battered shrimp and what I can only describe as ""dumplings"" and bao buns. The food was on point. An amazing culinary experience.

The manager and waitress were friendly.  But the food didn't taste fresh.  Not tasty I would say.  I wonder why there are so many good reviews...
Lunch in July 2024 I was a little apprehensive going here due to the negative reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of service was amazing, our waiter was lovely, all staff were friendly. The food was absolutely delicious, we had the garlic bruschetta for starters, the risotto for mains and tiramisu for dessert. I would definitely recommend and I want to go again too. The atmosphere was great, lots of people, by 6.30 the place was packed (considering they open at 6). We recently had the pleasure of dining at Buonissimo in Harbourne, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The food was absolutely delightful, with each dish bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The menu offers a fantastic selection, ensuring there’s something for everyone. We highly recommend trying the pork belly and the tiramissu , both of which were standout items.

The wine selection is impressive, featuring a variety of options that perfectly complement the meals. Whether you’re a wine connoisseur or just enjoy a good glass with dinner, you’ll find something to love here.

The service was top-notch, with attentive and friendly staff who made us feel welcome and well-cared for throughout our meal. The atmosphere was equally excellent, with a open and vibrant ambiance that made for a great dining experience.

One of the best parts about Buonissimo is the value for money. Despite the high quality of the food and service, the prices are very reasonable, making it a great choice for both special occasions and casual dining.

Additionally, there’s plenty of local paid parking available, which makes it convenient for those driving to the restaurant.

Overall, Buonissimo is a gem that we highly recommend. Whether you’re looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion or just want a great meal, this restaurant won’t disappoint. I am not sure how to do this but here it is, my 3rd week at QE hospital, lots of investigations tests etc… a very special day today, International women’s day, I felt that I want something special to eat.
Checking Google maps for restaurants nearby I came across with this Italian restaurant Buonissimo. Pretty from the pictures, attractive menu just I wasn’t sure if they do take away so I called. Pretty little voice answered, that was Irma. I explained what I want and she only had to check with chef if food collection was ok.
Chef Mark comes on the phone and he finds out that I am in hospital and family will come to collect food etc. Next thing he starts recommending what he believes it’s suitable for me, about the food texture and storage everything that I needed but I didn’t know nothing about it.
Cut the story short, my family picked up the food and delivered to me with a lovely note from Irma and chef Mark, a wonderful bunch of flowers and of course a delightful Tiramisu from them ❤️.
I have no words to describe the feelings and the emotions I felt. The food I had was Pate D’anatra as starters and Rigatoni alla Buonissimo, sorry I have no pictures of the food but I have photos of the most touching gesture I have ever had in my life !!!
Thank you so much for the good wishes🙏🏼
Food was amazing, delightful taste, I believe the bread is baked in the house. Outstanding Customers service, very friendly team.

I was only here for a drink so can't comment on the food. The interior has been done up nicely, and the beer selection is better than an average pub, I went for the Beavertown Neck Oil.

I don't know how to explain this, but the vibe seemed a little off, and slightly kind of uncomfortable and maybe unwelcoming? I'm not able to articulate properly in words what I mean, but it was enough to make me move on elsewhere after one drink. I have since looked through other reviews on here that seem to corroborate my view. A special shout-out to Sophie, Lucy, and Helen, who were nothing short of exceptional. Their warm, friendly service and genuine attentiveness made our visit really memorable.

What impressed us even more was how accommodating they were. We’d asked if we could watch the F1, and without hesitation, they made it happen for us — such a thoughtful touch that really went above and beyond. Was looking for a place for lunch on my first day in Birmingham. Stumbled into the Trocadero.  Staff was super friendly and prices were decent. They have happy hour from 5 to 8 M-F.  Ordered a cheese and bacon burger and it was a real patty.

Over the next few days I made it my routine stop of drinks. The staff here are fantastic and as a traveler made me feel very welcome. If you're lucky enough to get Lucy, Santino, or Paulina, you're in good hands.

Location is great too, in the heart of the city centre, close to New Street Station.  Definitely worth popping in for a pint if you're in Birmingham. Since Wetherspoons decided to stop doing steaks at their pub chains. Me and my needed somewhere in town that still do it.. So we decided to go to the trocadero and try it out as we never been in there for food.

We went for the 16oz Steak with Peppercorn Sauce and a side portion on Crispy Prawn, which also had a side of Chips, Tomato, Mushroom and Garden Peas.

Brilliant price ans quality of food ans service by the two colleagues Heather and Levi who served me today. I had such a fantastic experience at Trocadero — this place truly knows how to make you feel welcome! From the moment we walked in, the hospitality was outstanding.

Straight away worker (Aniket) said I cannot serve you.

Service needs to be improved. ordered click and collect. was so messy couldn’t even call it a sandwich. bread was thin and not like the usual subway baguette i get. when you open it
it literally fell entirely apart. i’ve ate here before and have had better experience. I am not sure why the staff at this specific store are always so impatient, I never go during lunch hour, I was the only one there and they act like there are hundred people waiting in line.

They never have the patience to place the food on the bread normally but always tossing them on there ( much less amount than other stores) yet have the time to pick the smallest slice of tomato ( as big as your thumb nail), I saw the female staff picked a normal sized tomato slice first then dropped it and picked the smallest one. It’s like the ingredients comes out of their wallet.

I could live with that until in my sandwich there I bit into sth really hard, and there were two, felt like small pieces of rocks, and that never ever happened to any Subway stores I ve been to. This is one of my two favourite Subway branches from all of the West Midlands and even London.
The restaurant is hidden away just off the University Guild so gets missed to the main eateries on site. What a pity. This a gem. And the staff are sofriendly its a great shame if you miss out.
I always chat away for a good 20 minutes whenever I visit as the staff are pretty laid back sa they are students or of that age group.
Very generous too on drinks and fillings.
Just look to the cycle shelter to the West side of the Guild to see the signage. The food was OK but service was rushed and there was only me and my friend in there.

And we had some vouchers. This pizza express has completely changed my mind. Probably the best pizza I have had in a long time. We were very well looked after. The staff very friendly. Superb food. Absolutely loved it. Thank u. Went to visit Pizza Express for lunch a few weeks ago.
The restaurant is bright and cheerful with comfortable seating.

We enjoyed our food which was a pizza and cannelloni pasta. It came quickly and it was pleasantly served.

Good value of money. Nice place.
Stopped by when rolling around and sat outside.
Ordered a beer and food which hit the spot!
A visiting family from france seen i was a skater taking a break and their son was also on skates ( cool) and wanted to sit with the other skater so came on in and ordered.
Once done the father asked if i would skate with their son for a bit. Sure! so had a little roll round so they could take momento videos back with them. All in all a good pit stop. Location, food and a skate...Result Popped in before heading to the Utilita Arena, no reservation but got a seat right away.

Service was really friendly and the choices of food and drink were incredible, at a reasonable price (even more reasonable if download the app and join the Pizza Express Club!).

We shared a starter of Calamari which was delicious - breaded rather that battered. I had the king prawn laggara and my partner the standard king prawn pizza - both were delicious and we loved it! We were stuffed after so we shared some sorbet for dessert (a scoop of coconut and a scoop of watermelon). For drinks I had a garden gin and tonic, and my partner had a red wine. Both lovely.

And I must say definitely worth the price. I loved the chicken curry meals. The spice levels are perfect for south Indians. It was perfect Tamilnadu style chicken gravy. Also kerala meals is a great vegetarian option, which has so many sides which makes it more worthy of the money we pay. I would definitely recommend this place. The person who servers and is in the counter is so sweet and amazing. Would visit again to try something else.

Edit: next i tried this parota and paneer butter masala, I regret my decisions. Paneer gravy was too sweet not good. Parota was average taste. Never buy that panner butter masala. The biryani was alright. However, the service was terrible. Ordered mutton biryani but received chicken. No pickles or poppadoms, and we waited forever for the raita. For three biriyani's, we split one small raita. We ordered lassi, but it's unclear whether he forgot or intentionally withheld it from us. Unable to even offer a glass of water. Average sitting space. I really wanted to try more, but after everything, I felt like I should leave that establishment right away. The food is really good here, a great menu with a wide selection of south Indian style dishes. The curries are rich and deep in flavour, the dosas are light and crisp and the devil dishes are not to be missed. Great value for some of my favourite curries in Birmingham. At amaa dosa, the extensive menu offers a plethora of options to choose from, making it a haven for dosa enthusiasts. The dosas, while priced reasonably, deliver on flavor, striking a balance between quality and cost. The restaurant boasts a pleasant atmosphere that enhances the dining experience. However, a notable drawback is the significantly slow service, which may test the patience of customers.

Despite the service lag, the overall taste falls somewhere between mediocre and exceptional, lacking brilliance but not disappointing. The culinary offerings are not exceptional, but they manage to meet expectations without being subpar. In summary, the dining experience at amaa dosa can be characterized as good, with the menu variety and reasonable dosa prices contributing positively. Improvement in service efficiency could elevate the overall experience, but the ambiance and satisfactory taste ensure a generally positive impression. 5-star for the food but overall service was poor and need some attention there. We have to wait for sometime just for someone to address and take our order but maybe cuz they start small and in future they will work on it. They bought the food a bit late but once we tasted, we forgot the delay and enjoyed every bit of it.

My order number was 1070, placed around 5:16 PM. Before I could even order, I waited at the counter for five minutes. When I politely inquired if orders were taken there, a staff member responded with shocking rudeness. She snapped, 'Do you not know how to use a kiosk?' making me feel incredibly foolish.

I explained that the last time I used a kiosk, it didn't accept cash. Instead of assisting, she barked several things at me, refused to take my order, when i stuck up for myself. and warned, 'Don't get me mad!' I was appalled by her aggressive tone, especially since I had done nothing wrong. It felt as though she was taking out her frustrations on me, which is completely unacceptable. I've worked in fast food myself and never treated a customer with such disrespect.

Her behavior made me feel violated. Had I not really wanted KFC, I would have walked out immediately. When I asked her colleague for her name the orignal staff member intervened again, shouting, 'Ask me, innit? I'm here!' in a threatening manner. When I asked her name, she said it was 'Rebecca,' but something tells me that wasn't her real name, as she was the only one without a name tag. In the whole kfc branch.

This employee's inappropriate, almost gangster-like behavior is unacceptable for someone in a customer service role. She needs to be held accountable for her actions and, frankly, should be terminated. No customer should be subjected to such treatment. I like this KFC. Friendly service. Delicious ice cream. Tasty chicken. Worth coming here. Food nice lovely and hot freshly fried a bit of a wait as always busy buts it's the best one in Birmingham sitting indoors upstairs and downstairs screen orders and counter service available. Toilets 🚻 inside a disabled one so a key needed a ramp and disabled access available As an experienced senior hospitality manager, Absolutely disgraceful. Had to clear a table myself to sit at with my mother and best friend as they were too busy closing off seating areas and the milkshake machine over 2 hours before closing with at least 5 (that I could see) staff members on shift. Had to change our milkshake to a Pepsi which we didnt even want, because it would be ""25minutes"" for milkshake as they'd turned the machine off. Again, I work in the industry, half hour to 15mins before closing i totally get, but all this sort of thing over 2 hours before closing time? Absolutely disgraceful. Dirty tables, dirty restaurant and not even busy. Clearly dont care about anything more than getting their paycheck. And to top it all off they even got my order wrong, had to go up to them to get the correct burger for my box meal. Literally no excuse, try me ive heard them all. I'm a regular here and Everytime I feel similar taste with the mini fillet, fries and the pepper favour of fries are to die for ..

Usually have a meal here and it's nice and sometimes the wings are dry and unable to make us eat more than 5 at once but other than that it's usually good compared to other KFC

Seating is a bit odd as most of times the basement kinda seating is closed and around 8pm they start closing most of seating area leaving 3-4 sets of tables around and it's a bit of shame to see this and walk away when we got friends with us so plan carefully ..",0.6,0.4,"[""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Fast Food"", ""Mediterranean"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone""]","['kfc', 'closing', 'milkshake', 'hours closing', 'kiosk', 'seating', 'behavior', 'unacceptable', 'disabled', 'orders']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Service"", ""Mediterranean"", ""seating"", ""kfc"", ""Dessert"", ""Food Quality"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""unacceptable"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Cleanliness"", ""hours closing"", ""kiosk"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Fast Food"", ""orders"", ""closing"", ""milkshake"", ""behavior"", ""disabled"", ""Burger"", ""Experience""]"

The design of the place, only four. They didn't just the canal atmosphere. You aren't sure what kind of decorations are the main line.
Some wooden tables, some paintings fish on walls, some modern neons,  for me the music is just jazz and rhythmic.

Exactly what we needed, would definitely come again! Fabulous lunch and the food was first class. Absolutely loved my dessert. Extra marks to our waiter Rivali who was brilliant. The industry needs more people like him! This branch of Zizzi was lovely,  and they were very accommodating with my wheelchair and with a coeliac in our party. All of the food and drinks that we had were lovely (Although my salmon and avocado salad barely had any avocado in - definitely not as pictured!)
The only gripe, in terms of the atmosphere,  was that the music was so loud it was difficult to hear each other talk over it. 😬
Other than that,  we really enjoyed it (-although the chairs were very uncomfortable, and we all got quite stiff sitting in them).

The rooms are of a very high standard, although a little dark. They are very spacious and are built to a high quality.

The staff are very friendly and accommodating.

The bar has an extensive drinks menu and the happy hour prices are very inviting.

Lastly onto the food. I rarely eat at hotel restaurants, but the food here is excellent. Easily on par with a respectable restaurant.

I highly recommend staying here if you're visiting Birmingham. I only booked a night here for after the Kendrick Lamar concert. But it was an excellent stay. The rooms were amazing. I actually got a free upgrade! The room was spacious, they had all the right amenities, including free bottled water. The hotel is located right by the train station so it’s really easy to get to. The service was excellent from the front desk and the hospitality staff. The breakfast was great too, I liked that it has both a continental buffet and cooked options you can choose from. The choices are a bit limited but most people will find something they’ll like. If I come back to Birmingham, I’ll be staying again. Overall this is pretty good hotel. I've not used the gym or spa facilities. I have always visited on business trips. Rooms are generally impeccable, but I will say they are starting to show their age. However, still a very good experience. Breakfast wise, you get great service and the food is, for the most part, good. I think there's the odd chef that isn't up to the standards of the others, but to be honest, I've never thought to complain. It's pretty darn ok, ya know.

If there were any complaints, it is this: please, please give complementary lip balm! The air con is very needed, but dries your lips fast. I have always left the hotel with crunchy, painful lips!! Amazing Stay at Malmaison Birmingham!

I recently stayed at Malmaison Birmingham for two nights and had a truly wonderful experience. From the moment I arrived, the staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and professional they really set the tone for a great stay.

The room was spotless, stylish, and very comfortable. Everything felt fresh and well-maintained, making it easy to relax. I was also impressed with the breakfast a fantastic spread with delicious options that really exceeded expectations.

The location couldn’t be better right in the heart of Birmingham, making it super convenient to get around and explore the city. Everything was easy to find and navigate.

The only small suggestion I’d make is that I would have appreciated being told about the spa services at check-in. I only found out about them through the in room leaflet, and it would’ve been great to know earlier to plan ahead.

Overall, an amazing stay and I’d happily return. Highly recommended! Great reception staff, nice and cheery, lovely all round.

Loved the servers, they were friendly, nice, attentive and made sure you was okay with everything such as tissues etc.

Emmer was honestly nothing short of delightful, very charismatic, very friendly and laid back, and truthfully she made the entire experience so much better. I ordered the crispy fried calamari, thai duck stir fry, and the passion fruit martini. the calamari was delicious and i really enjoyed the stir fry too, i couldn’t finish  the stir fry in the end but i had it packed to take home! as for the drink, a shot of prosecco was served on the side and though i’m new to alcohol it was actually really lovely if i had it with the cocktail :) i was checked in on here and there while eating to make sure i was happy with the food and service which i found really nice. will definitely be coming back for a dessert and coffee next time. i’m really enthusiastic on trying new things so this was my first time at giraffe, i do often get a little anxiety beforehand though but this really did not disappoint. the interior and lights were also a really nice touch.

also please give Emmer a raise or a promotion, she’s amazing and so so incredibly sweet. Sometimes looks deceive you, chicken was tough to chew, quite over charred too, chips ordered as an extra were tough too, like they were left to go cold and recooked, not a great experience.
Chicken on the burger was tough and again like it was left and reheated.
Staff consumed with their own conversations, shouting across tables to continue conversations? Visited here on the 13th February 2025 around 18:30, date and time is relevant as if the manager reads this they should recognise the members of staff on duty and the food and service was excellent!

For a railway station I didn’t really expect too much especially having had a previous poor experience at another location.

Very pleasantly surprised. Beautiful food, beautiful staff specially the guy with the glasses and bowl cut. I just immigrated from Nepal and was met with only good hospitality and amazing atmosphere. Would recommend anyone from Nepal to come and try this!! Great visit! Several vegan options on the menu. Well presented food and tasted lovely. Able to use a plug socket at the table to work.

Highly recommended for anyone with a love for delicious desserts!! Grossly disappointing.

We ordered 2 items one worse than the other. They claim to serve the best karak chai ins selly oak, the less I say the better, watery and pathetic. Next item was the chocolate lava cake. Surprise surprise, there is no chocolate inside it and the crust is weirdly hard. Went to the guy on the counter he said that the chocolate is the lava, pls see the pics yourself. Devine Desserts in Selly Oak is an absolute gem! From the moment I walked in, the staff were so nice and lovely, making the experience even more enjoyable. I decided to try their karak chai, and it was absolutely delicious—perfectly spiced and comforting. Their waffles were incredibly fresh and soft, with just the right amount of crispiness, making them the perfect treat.

As a flat white lover, I was thrilled to find that theirs was spot on—smooth, rich, and satisfying. It’s amazing to have such a great spot nearby for when those cravings hit.

The patty was properly grilled but still juicy. The hot sauce was mildly spicy (good if you have weak tolerance) and tasted a bit bitter at first but developed a fruity flavor later. The fries had coleslaw on top and tasted as you would expect. We stopped by this spot recently, and wow—what a treat! I had the Pineapple Express burger with the ODB fries, and my husband went for the Louisiana Slammer, added a beef patty to it (one of the specials) with buffalo fries. Let me just say, the food exceeded our expectations.

Everything came out hot, fresh, and full of flavour. The burgers were juicy and perfectly cooked, and the fries were next-level good. But overall, I have to give a special shoutout to the sauce on the Pineapple Express—it totally made my day. I ended up going back up and ordering a side of it just to have more!

The whole experience was fantastic and we had an excellent server who explained the Specials for us and made everything feel personalised. We’re already looking forward to going back. I consider myself as a regular at OPM but when I visited it at 11.06.2025 around 7pm, I think I won’t be anymore. I sat outside because the weather was quite lovely. Tables were a mess, all dirt and leftovers. Nobody came to take our orders nor clean the table for 15 minutes. When I walked inside, waitress in the bar took my order, said that I should pay in advance because I’m outside and didn’t even bother to come and clean up. Patty was really dry and chewy and their special crunchy wings were just sloppy. All around terrible. Delicious food and a friendly joint. They were very friendly. I got the vegan special, spicy fries, and slaw. Everything was great. Probably the best slaw I've had in the UK (at least for someone that likes cilantro).
The vegan schnitzel burger was reaaaally good.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying another burger and maybe a cocktail or beer on tap! I’ve been here before several years ago and definitely remember it being better. That, or because so many independent & chain American smash burger places have opened, that I’m comparing to them. The market is now saturated for this type of food and unfortunately OPM does not cut it. The burgers are dense overcooked patties, and didn’t even seem to be decent quality beef. The menu was small, I think 3 or 4 beef burgers (for a place that’s got patty in the name), other than fries there were only 2 side options and one of them was coleslaw.

It may have been  the worst Chinese I've ever had .
I really don't like giving bad reviews to small businesses but sorry to say it wasn't good ..

The lady serving is friendly and polite .
I ordered a few dishes with rice and noodles sides ,  everything was bland and the meats were overcooked  and dry .. pork ribs were coloured bright red  but the meat was tasteless and tough ,
Chicken dish was poor & flavourless
Roast duck , don't waste your money !  ours was actually burnt and cut in to cubes ?? Dry and tasteless again ..
3 dishes plus rice and noodles cost £36!

Sorry but I wouldn't return and definitely wouldn't recommend trying it out .. It was edible not the best for me personally. However I only tried one dish. Chicken and pork special with rice. I'm yet to try the other dishes they have to offer. Not sure I will after the first one if I'm honest. Chicken was nice and the rice was cooked well but the pork was well over cooked and rubbery.

Our meals came quickly even though it was utter mayhem with the amount of people.  Staff looked tired and fed up,  no smiles just blunt comments with serious faces. I understand that they must be worked off their feet and it was so hot, so i don't blame them for being low in energy. Especially if they are at the end of their shifts.
We were halfway through our meal and still had no drinks,  we were told there was 25 minute wait but we had already been waiting half hour.  It was a really hot evening and we were parched so I asked a passing lad who worked there about them,  he went and got them for us.  Shortly after necking our sodas, we needed another but the bar was 3 layers thick with people waiting.  It took us another 25 minutes to finally get served,  there was no order to the serving and we were walked by several times,  and other people who hadn't waited as long as us got served.
Then suddenly,  a bar fairy full of smiles,  bounding energy and gorgeous floaty sleeves fluttered into the bar,  zooming around making polite happy comments to customers and cleared up the back log in a mere 10 minutes. Whoever she was,  she was absolutely fantastic! Shortly after in the bathroom she was flitting around filling up the toilet rolls as every stall was empty in the ladies!
She was a breath of fresh air.
Anyway,  the food was rather good, just don't expect quick service at the bar.
Find this wetherspoons fairy and prime her,  give her a raise because she is a credit to that place. Warm and welcome from the station, lots of glass to watch as people go by, low prices compared to other places in the centre.  Lots of tables from small twin to Boothe and app ordering  which is quick and simple.  Menu is good, very reasonable, food was good and turned up fast.",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Seafood"", ""Breakfast""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone""]","['bar', 'fairy', 'people', 'shortly', 'comments', 'long', 'spoons', 'people waiting', 'station', 'waiting']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Service"", ""comments"", ""Breakfast"", ""people"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""bar"", ""station"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""shortly"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""people waiting"", ""fairy"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Seafood"", ""spoons"", ""Value"", ""long"", ""waiting""]"

Parking can be busy in the city so I recommend planning your parking in advance but there is plenty of choice. The venue itself isn't especially large and if you're less than six foot tall I'd recommend buying tickets in the stalls not in the main standing area. The venue is well managed and it's recommended as a great location to see a show on a fun night out. Good music venue, two rooms. One with a balcony, which is better if like me, you need to sit down. However the second room has nowhere to sit, standing only, which can be a little awkward. Drinks are the usual mega expensive, so don’t be tempted to really drink, unless money isn’t a difficulty. First in the Queue for seats, none reserved, but they do let disabled in first for that reason. Sound quality good, and overall, a good venue. I  recently attended a gig at the O2 Academy Birmingham and had an absolutely brilliant night. The venue has a great vibe — intimate enough to feel connected to the performance, yet big enough to handle a solid crowd without feeling cramped. The sound quality was impressive; every instrument came through clearly, and the vocals were spot on, which really brought the energy of the night to life.

The layout of the venue is smart, with decent views of the stage from most areas, and the tiered levels in the main room make it easier to see even if you’re not right at the front. The lighting setup added to the atmosphere, especially during high-energy tracks, and the acoustics made the whole experience even more immersive.

Staff and security were professional, friendly, and handled everything smoothly — from ticket checks to helping people find their way around. Entry was well organized and the bar staff were quick, even at peak times, which is always appreciated at a packed show.

Facilities were clean and well maintained, and the cloakroom was handy for storing jackets and bags. If I had to nitpick, the drinks were a little on the expensive side — not outrageous, but enough to notice. Still, that’s not unusual for live venues and didn’t take away from the night.

Overall, the O2 Academy Birmingham is a top-tier venue for live music. It’s got everything you need for a great night out and consistently delivers a quality concert experience. I’ll definitely be back for more gigs. O2 venues often get a bad rap. I like them. Been to this one many, many times. View is great from wherever. Sound can often be good. Staff are always pleasant. Sure we can complain about beer prices but 🤷🏻 Saw The Brogeals and The Latham's last night. All the staff members we came across were very helpful and friendly. Really appreciated the staff passing out water at the front of the stage as it got very hot. The security and ticket system on the way in was very smooth, just for visitors who don't have your ticket page open on the O2 App for ages as you'll need to refresh the page a few times before the tickets scan. As soon as the gig ended, staff checked on people sat down and were immediately tidying up. NPC car park is literally next door to the venue for anyone coming from far away.  Sound was great for the gig as was the lightning.

CASH FREE RESTAURANT.
Half term is time to find the bestie places to go with kids.

This week we chose Pizza Hut because said that kids eat for free when you spend £10, BUT IS ONE KID FOR EVERY TRANSACTION, If you have a family with more that one child you only will get one child free at least that you do separate purchases for the food.
We do not make a booking before coming to the place, we has been there before and wasn’t so busy, but is half term so the best option is make in advance.

The Manager very friendly find the way to gives us a table, after one of the staff said that were very busy.

You have to scan QR code to make you order and pay online.

If you buy the promo for the buffet time is brilliant, you will have fresh pizzas, actually you can see when come out from the oven, the variety is very good and the salads island is okay, but I’m not a salad person.

And have refill with drinks and ice cream is absolutely amazing, specially if you want give a reward to your kids after hard work at school, plus have kids that finish SATs, deserve every penny that you spend.

Buy have no space for ramp or lift.

Was full of people but is okay, when you have kids you can manage be in a noise atmosphere.

The staff do as much as they can. Such a cute and cosy location. The Food was delicious and filling with the Me-Deal. I put 3 stars for the food and overall 4 stars. Only because I would prefer to have more vegan options. Otherwise it's a great family friendly option and a comfortable dining area too ❤️🍕 Kate was very helpful as you have to order and pay all on your phone. The staff friendly
The 3 star for the food was because the chips were not done well, but the vegan pizza was ok. The vegan cheese cake was yum too. Food came out quickly On February 22nd, I visited Pizza Hut with my niece, who had never been there before. We ordered a sharer deal, which included a Half & Half pizza with chicken and pepperoni, two sides, and two desserts for £40. Although it was a bit pricey, the food was very enjoyable. We also had the delicious cookie dough for dessert each 😁

The staff member we encountered wasn't very enthusiastic, but we didn't let that affect our mood since we were there for the food. We placed our order through the app, which seemed unnecessary, especially since other tables were paying in cash. But our waiter said was the only way took a while for us to get our drinks too

Overall food was brilliant and we saw other staff members been more than helpful so I was unlucky 🤣 We will be back Today my family and I visited Pizza Hut Birmingham City Centre and were fortunate to be looked after by Kate. She was warm, attentive, and genuinely friendly from the moment she came over to our table.

Kate made us feel welcome, engaged kindly with the children, and regularly checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. Her positive attitude and approachable manner created such a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere.

It’s not often you meet someone who brings such energy and care to their work, Kate truly made our visit memorable.

I came in craving something sweet and was not disappointed. I had the kunafa milk cake, which was a perfect balance of rich, creamy texture and just the right amount of sweetness. It was soft, flavorful, and beautifully presented.

My friend ordered the kunafa pistachio milkshake, which was freshly made to order and full of nutty, creamy goodness. To make the experience even better, we were generously treated to a free scoop of ice cream of our choice, which was such a thoughtful and unexpected surprise.

The staff were warm and welcoming, the atmosphere was cozy, and every bite showed real care and quality. If you love desserts or are just looking for something indulgent and delicious, this place is absolutely worth a visit. Ordered a waffle from Ubereats.

It looked fine until- I started eating it and found a long strand of black hair in the waffle!!

I had to throw it away as it was very off putting.

Will not be ordering again. After a long night, we just wanted to relax and enjoy some mocktails but this place was a huge disappointment. When we arrived, there was only one couch in the whole place—not what we expected at all.

The mocktails were over £10 each which is already overpriced, but when they arrived, they were warm and had bits floating in them—definitely not what you’d expect from a place serving drinks. We ordered the Berry Explosion and Blue Mist and honestly, neither tasted good. The flavour’s were off and the whole experience just felt like a waste of money.

Would not recommend—overpriced, bad drinks and not a great atmosphere. This dessert shop has been an exceptional experience so far. I first tried their Oreo shake, which was nothing short of heavenly—rich, creamy, and perfectly blended. Impressed, I reached out to the shop, where a courteous lady recommended another dessert. I ordered it through Uber, and it exceeded my expectations—soft, delightfully sweet, and incredibly flavorful. It had been a long time since I enjoyed such a delicious dessert in Birmingham, and this place has truly set a new standard for indulgence. We ordered various items only to receive some. We contacted the vendor only to be advised no mistake had been made, despite highlighting what we’d ordered and the extras we’d paid for the vendor  advised they were to busy to take the matter further.

In addition to your response, did the Uber Driver forget to add the rest of the fruit to the order and sauces as Berrylicious came with just Blueberries and some random sauce nothing like what’s decribed or pictured on UBER EATS, picture added for reference?",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Communication/Responsiveness"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['dessert', 'uber', 'creamy', 'vendor', 'rich creamy', 'mocktails', 'kunafa', 'waffle', 'advised', 'overpriced']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Communication/Responsiveness"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""Dessert"", ""advised"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""overpriced"", ""mocktails"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""vendor"", ""Cafe"", ""uber"", ""rich creamy"", ""kunafa"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""waffle"", ""dessert"", ""Value"", ""creamy"", ""Experience""]"

The minimum Bets are low for Roulette (£2) which is good 😉  Blackjack is £10.  People say the staff are nice, some are, some I feel are just incompetent 👎.
Whilst playing Roulette, the Croupier swiped all the chips and didn't pay me out, I questioned this, he wasn't sure.  The small miserable female Pit Boss (with Glasses) sternly told me I was wrong (like she was even watching??) I challenged her asking her to review the CCTV, she kept refusing saying I was mistaken (I knew I wasn't).  Ultimately I asked the Manager to check the CCTV, and I WAS CORRECT👍
I don't think I'd go back there again, with incompetent Croupiers and crappy Pit Bosses, there's better places I can spend my money 👎 normally have a good experience , but the staff are severely unfriendly and moody all the time
today , i had 21 and dealer drew to 20 and quickly took my chips away and moved on to the next hand. i raised that i should’ve been payed out and i was met with aggression and hostility. they did check the cctv and found i was right, but instead of a profuse apology like any other establishment would give, all I received was a murmur of ‘pay the young man 30£’
aside from this , i do get offered drinks / food which is a nice gesture but then again i am praising staff for the bare minimum. Paul and Molly and Luke was absolutely amazing. I loved playing at the casino. Very nice people, offered me drinks and would recommend more people to come. It’s worth it!!! Staff are rude and/or miserable. I had a double vodka and Diet Coke and hubby had half a draft beer and it was £15! Just a standard vodka, not grey goose or anything premium!  The min bet on roulette was £5 or £25 for side bets.

Thank you! The food and service was amazing. I had the king prawn katsu curry and rice and the gyozas and also chicken ramen and I loved it. Connor, I believe his name was, was my server and he was very accommodating and friendly. He helped me in deciding what to eat and was very nice to speak to. 10/10 Not the best tonkotsu ramen I’ve had – it lacked the creaminess and depth of flavour you’d expect, but overall the quality was decent.

They have live rock bands on weekends from time to time. Not a very big venue.
A couple of pool tables to the side at only £1 per game, making it popular. No thrills and fair prices at the bar.
We just popped into play pool and have a few drinks.
Good atmosphere Friday night.
Obviously music is not to everyone's taste, unless you like rock.
They have a small garden at the back for smokers. If you've left a club at say  2am and need somewhere to go as its too early to go home then it has to be Subside.

Horrible, horrible, horrible! This is by far the worst place I have ever stayed in my life. The staff were shockingly unfriendly—completely lacking basic manners or any sense of customer service.

My room was boiling hot, and when I asked the receptionist if I could move to a cooler room, she didn’t even bother to check the system. She just said, “All rooms are fully booked,” with an attitude like she owns the entire Travelodge. No apology, no effort, nothing.

I felt dismissed, disrespected, and completely let down. I’ve stayed in budget hotels before, but this was something else—zero professionalism, zero empathy. I honestly wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone.

This stay has left a bad memory I’ll never forget. Avoid this place at all costs! Can't fault it. On approach quite late on a Sunday night there was a nice of activity which was a concern for my nights sleep. However. Quick check im and nice staff. Rooms were clean modern with plenty of tea and coffee, and I slept like a baby. All for £28. Try find a cheaper room of the same quality. Bang in centre  of town Great stay overall! The room was cool, clean, and in a peaceful part of Birmingham — a nice break from the busy city centre. The view was lovely too! The receptionist was super friendly and chatty, which made the check-in process quick and welcoming. I booked online and had my key within seconds, which was really convenient. Looking forward to trying the breakfast tomorrow. So far, a smooth and pleasant experience! I would like to give a special mention to Rav who was working in the restaurant at breakfast time for going above and beyond to provide an excellent service. She ensured we had a hot breakfast buffet prepared around 7am even though it wasn't due out until 8am to ensure that we were able to eat a hot meal before travelling to another city. At the end of breakfast she even gave me and my husband a Kit Kat chocolate to take with us on our travels. We had a booking on the 5th of July. As we were attending a concert that evening we arrived to check in at 11:30pm, only to be told that our room was no longer available, allegedly due to a flood.. Whilst this excuse was questionable, we were offered an alternate Travelodge 30 minutes away. We agreed to stay there, as we had no other choice, and the man on the desk said he would call a taxi to take us there. 40 minutes later, there was no sign of a taxi and when asking where the taxi is, the man on the desk said he hadn't ordered it. There were also two security men in reception that evening who were incredibly rude when asking if we could use a bathroom whilst waiting.

We decided to make our own way home as nothing was being done to arrange an alternative room.

When dealing with customer services, we were given a refund on the room, but nothing else in terms of compensation. This is incredibly disappointing as we had to pay to get home. (We had no confidence there would even be another room at the other Travelodge).

We were not told prior that our room was no longer available. My suspicion would be they gave our room to someone else for a hire rate as we'd not checked in earlier. If there was a flood, surely we would have been contacted..

I would avoid this Travelodge, but also the wider group as the customer service has been terrible.",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Dessert"", ""Breakfast""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['room', 'travelodge', 'horrible', 'taxi', 'check', 'longer available', 'breakfast', 'stay', 'receptionist', 'zero']","[""check"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""Breakfast"", ""Dessert"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""room"", ""Waiting Time"", ""breakfast"", ""stay"", ""Location"", ""receptionist"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""longer available"", ""zero"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""travelodge"", ""horrible"", ""taxi"", ""Value"", ""Experience""]"

Bought a sports bra from here too, which is brilliant quality.
They offer student discount.
Friendly staff. Very welcoming environment. So much fun... looking forward to going back. Even though they are the only bouldering place in Birmingham, they are still very good. Facilities are clean and readily available, and prices are clear. Boulders are changed regularly enough to go for fun consistently and have new routes to try.

My only gripe is if you're a new climber, the customer service can be a bit misunderstanding of what you know and that can be rude. If you know what the shoes are and how to climb its chill (watch some videos). Great bouldering centre. Very open and relaxed atmosphere.

Good coffee. Friendly and helpful staff.

Well worth a visit just to check him out. Rustic presence. A beautiful station featuring its own mechanical bull. Why can't more railway stations have large mechanical animals? The only issue is that it's a hard station to find when outside, as it's frequently hidden from view, with not much in the way of maps or sign-posts to locate it! A decent large train station with a wide range of services across the country. There are several facilities throughout here and quite a few places to sit and wait. Bright, airy and welcoming. The staff are generally friendly too. The layout is excellent, considering it’s an updated existing station. The platforms are a bit tight and it’s better to wait upstairs, but it’s massively better than it was and fantastic when compared to ANY of the London stations! It is a very nice place to go to, The staff are nice. Many platforms feature many trains. Hard to do spotting considering it's such a big place!

The service was excellent – friendly staff and everything was brought out in good time.

I had the chicken wrap, which was packed with flavour, juicy chicken, and a nice kick of spice. The chips were crispy and well-seasoned, and the pasta was creamy and comforting – perfect as a side dish.

To note, the menu says signature chips, but it's just regular chips, albeit they weren't greasy or thin french fries.

Even ordered a doggy bag to go.

Overall, it was really solid food, generous portions, and a place I’d happily return to. Great value and quality!

⭐ Rating: 9/10 ⭐ Absolutely love this spot! Piri Fino in Selly Oak is a gem — proper good food at great prices. I tried the pasta with chicken on a staff recommendation and it was amazing — full of flavour, cooked perfectly. I liked it so much I went back the next day and got the chicken burger with wings and chips. The BBQ wingers were banging. Definitely one of my new go-to places near uni. We had a fantastic lunch here. The lads were amazing, gave us maximum attention and were all very polite. Our boy didn't like mayo in his burger we we forgot to say at the till. Told the guys and changed it promptly. Great food, fresh and hot. Keep it up guys. I definitely recommend. All the sitting tables are booths by the way. Ordered food via Uber Eats this week for lunch. It was Chicken Ceasar Salad times 2. Unfortunately,  as it looks on website and actual food, no match and similarity. Very disappointed  and worst salad full of lettuce only. Sent email to restuarant few days ago, and called a staff to check and reply. No answer till date.   Not worth money and won't buy again.  Surely, anyone can see and tell looking at images. Expect restuarant to reply and look into it. Been to the other two branches Marston green and great Barr. This was closer and it was lovely. Has a great decking area outside. Very spacious plenty of seating and clean as always. The staff were lovely very friendly and helpful. The food was on point well flavoured and very well cook.

The Dubliners story told by part narration, part dialogue but musty their music, and an authentic bar setting (complete with realistic bartender) was topped by the fabulous energy of the cast.....despite the mature age of the lead character. Really great experience last night (28/01/25) went to see Murder on the Orient Express. From the get go of having our tickets scanned, being directed upstairs, bar service, seating, leg room, the performers, the way the show was on stage. It was a really good night. Only negative thing was from a safety point of view, the show started a little late which caused a very large build up of people in the bar area upstairs but it is what it is. We sat in Row K seats 8- 10 ( back row) Dress circle, we had a uninterrupted View of the stage and easy access to Mens and Ladies toilets. It was a very hot day and The Theatre was full but I felt it was a manageable heat. I would definitely choose the same seats again. Staff as always were friendly and helpful. I can't wait for my next visit. We recently attended a performance of War Horse at The Alexandra and had a truly wonderful experience, thanks in no small part to the exceptional staff and thoughtful accessibility arrangements.

One member of our group is a wheelchair user, and after reading the helpful guidance on the theatre’s website, I booked aisle seats as advised. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel incredibly welcome. At the main entrance, we were greeted by Pete—proudly nicknamed “Batman” on his badge—which instantly brought a smile to our faces. Pete went out of his way to assist us, even radioing ahead for support. When staff were momentarily tied up, he personally escorted us to the accessible entrance around the corner.

There, we were met by Ollie, who couldn't have been more helpful. He guided us to our seats and ensured the wheelchair was parked in a safe and convenient location, tucked out of the way but easily reachable.

After the show, Ollie discreetly kept an eye on us and returned the wheelchair when we were ready to leave, making our exit smooth and stress-free.

The service we received was genuinely above and beyond. Both Pete and Ollie were kind, proactive, and a credit to the theatre.

From the moment we walked in, the staff made us feel incredibly welcome. Their service was attentive, friendly, and professional, creating a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere throughout our visit. The venue itself is vibrant and stylish, with a warm, eclectic décor that gives it a lot of character. It’s the kind of place where you instantly feel comfortable, whether you're there for a casual bite or a longer evening out.

We opted for a selection of tapas, and every dish we tried was absolutely delicious. The menu offered a great variety, and everything was beautifully presented and full of flavour. The portions were generous too, which made sharing really enjoyable. It’s clear that care is taken not only with the food but also with the overall experience.

The lively yet laid-back vibe made it the perfect spot to unwind with friends. It’s rare to find a place that gets the balance of great food, top-notch service, and inviting ambiance just right, but Arco Lounge nails it.

We’ll definitely be returning soon—and recommending it to anyone looking for a great evening out. A real gem of a place! Was not impressed with the food or the service. Walked in and basically seated myself as staff were too busy chatting..ordered on table by QR code. The salmon and eggs on the English muffin came within 3 minutes and just felt like they heated it up and gave it to me. Didn't taste of anything at all. The mocha was equally as bad and came after the food was served. Will not be back here. My friends and I have been coming to the Arco lounge in Harbourne for a number of years and it never disappoints!
Serene atmosphere with the gentle lighting and music and the fab decor ( such a wide variety of paintings ) that compliment the warm and welcoming manner of staff especially the gentleman manager who served us today.
Thank you so much ( apologies for not asking your name) but your hot chocolates were delicious!!
You made us smile so much today and it’s was so lovely to feel appreciated for being returning customers who are remembered and appreciated-thank you, thank you!
And the food always fresh ,
tasty , great portions and value for money and as a vegan some firm favourites: simple sausage butty which the chef always makes bespoke for me ( bless) with side of grilled red onions , sliced avocado and mayo, the smashed avocado brunch or the bang bang cauliflower and least but not least favourite- the vegan chocolate & Raspberry Torte! Chocolate heaven ! A stunning ,cozy restaurant with great atmosphere and menu.Beautifully decorated and fantastic service and staff.
Thankyou for a great experience
Garf After being let down by a gluten free pub down the road we came to the Lounge as I’m celiac and the gluten free menu is amazing.

As the menu only offers 1 milkshake without biscuit I kindly asked if Kai would make an alternative milkshake which he was delighted to do at the end of the night after which I’m sure he had a long shift as a manager. He absolutely smashed it and it was one of the nicest milkshakes I’ve ever had! He went absolutely above and beyond I’ve had exceptional service, and I couldn’t of asked for anything more. He really turned mine and my girlfriends date night around after having a really bad start. Thank you so much for everything Kai!

These guys dont disappoint, food always on point. My favourite is the mixed donner and fries, the guys do an amazing combination with some extra spices added on, making this unique and addictive meal one of my favourites. The foods are good with very competitive prices, I prefer this restaurant than similar fast-food ones nearby. The service speed is okay, but the staff is a bit cold. There will be a 50p extra charge if paid by cards. Staff member serving was extremely rude and dismissive from the get go. Ordered a meal from the menu with a price clearly stated. Asked to pay with card and he didn't say the price, asked to see the card reader and after reluctantly showing me it was 50p more than stated. When challenging this he said its 50p for card payments, reminded him this is illegal and he refused to let me pay the correct price. Abandoned my order in the end on principle. After seeing other reviews its clear they are relying on people being too drunk not to challenge the extra charges they add on. Shocking experience with the shop. Was standing around for a minute before I was served.

Save yourself some time and money and walk to the one in New Street station. Tastes better, cleaner, and better service.

My burger was somehow dry and burnt whilst also being a wet soggy mess.

Chips were dry and hard as nails. It's a standard 5 Guys so no particular surprises with the food, service or restaurant ambiance.

Burgers are good but not exceptional.  Fries as always are a little over salted. Peanut butter shake was great. this five guys had a great atmosphere paired with delicious food me and my two children went there for lunch and the food was freshly prepared with little to no waiting the cajun seasoned fries were delicious milkshakes had a perfect consistency and a wide variety of flavours the burgers had lots of toppings to pick from to customise it overall a great meal and experience one of my favorite places to visit in the evening Fantastic burgers! It is expensive for a fast food place but it was totally worth it. The burger seemed small but they put so much stuff in it, and their patties are so big you realise how big of a burger is.

Thank you, Blossom! 💛 We were warmly welcomed and served by Mr. Waqar Khan, and from the moment we arrived, we felt truly at home. The children absolutely loved the stay, and the service was a perfect 10/10. Thank you, Mr. Khan you are such a kind and amazing person, and it’s clear how much passion you have for your work. The children adored every moment, and you made our experience even better than we could have imagined. We will definitely be returning with the whole family. Thank you once again for making our stay so special. Attended a corporate event here. Didn't stay over so can't comment on the rooms. Excellent location. Food- I had the vegetarian option which was very tasty, can't comment on the meat version which looked rather bland. Great, safe parking. Special mention to Matthew on reception who was very helpful and sorted out complimentary parking which was a huge bonus. My friend and I stayed at Park Regis Birmingham on 10th August for a birthday getaway, and from the moment we arrived, we were met with genuine warmth. A special thank you to Matthew and Azhar (apologies if I’ve misspelled your name!) who welcomed us so kindly at check-in—their hospitality set the tone for a truly memorable stay.

We were surprised with complimentary drinks and thoughtful extras, which added a personal and celebratory touch. The hotel itself was elegant, modern, and spotless. The lounge and bar area was spacious and beautifully designed, with a lovely outdoor view that made it perfect for relaxing.

One detail I especially appreciated was the fresh floral scent throughout the hotel—no unpleasant odours, just subtle notes that greeted us in lifts and corridors. It’s a small thing, but it speaks volumes about the care and attention to detail.

The staff were consistently attentive and accommodating, and the secure parking nearby made everything easy. Though we’re not from Birmingham, we explored Bullring, just a 20-minute walk or 5-minute drive away. The location is ideal for anyone wanting to enjoy the city’s buzz while staying somewhere peaceful and refined.

In short, Park Regis Birmingham offers the perfect blend of style, comfort, and heartfelt hospitality. Highly recommended.

Thank you. Our stay was very nice and a smooth experience from checking in to checking out.

The pizza arrived hot and fresh, with that signature soft, chewy crust and a generous layer of cheese. I went with the classic Pepperoni and added some extra mushrooms—flavors were solid and the toppings were nicely distributed.

The garlic dip is still one of the best parts of the meal—creamy, rich, and perfect for crust-dipping. The sides (cheesy garlic breadsticks and chicken poppers) were decent, though a little greasy.

Delivery was on time, packaging was secure, and everything was still warm when it arrived. Prices are a bit higher compared to some other chains, but the quality generally matches up.

Mr Abhinav is so kind and helpful What made the visit even better was the service. Abhinav was friendly, welcoming, and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. They offered great recommendations and made us feel like valued guests. It’s rare to find that kind of genuine hospitality these days. Ordered 2 pizzas on the app, one half and half bbq chicken and Hawaiian, one pepperoni stuffed crust. There was a problem with the app (or an issue on our end :/) and the pepperoni was ordered with no cheese. We phoned up immediately and spoke to a really helpful guy who sent us a new pizza with cheese for free. Really fast delivery time and gave us a call to say when they arrived. The service was amazing. Will definitely be ordering again. Thanks guys! Great Service and Customer Care

I recently visited Papa John’s, and the service was excellent. From the start, the staff - Abhi made me feel welcome and took the time to make sure my order was just right. They didn’t rush me and even gave helpful suggestions.

While I waited, Abhi kept me updated, which made me feel valued as a customer. When my pizza was ready, it was hot, fresh, and exactly how I ordered it. Overall, Abhi specifically provided an easy and enjoyable experience, with great customer service. I’ll definitely be coming back! Abhy took my order and was very friendly.

Gave it a try and can’t complain. Food was all fresh and hot, I got a loaded Sizzler box meal with a piece of chicken. The sizzler burger was the best bit in a really soft bun and the hot wings were nicely seasoned and had a crunchy batter. The only area they could improve would be their fries were soggy whereas I prefer crunchy fries. They have a huge menu to choose from!

Service was really fast and friendly from the guys behind the counter and the shop was clean and tidy. Honestly the best Dixy in Birmingham. The uber eats order had everything, every sauce and they added for free and the food was really fresh the quality of the chicken on point. Well done guys! Having ordered here regularly, I thought I'd write a review :)

Food is always fresh and hot, the quality is quite good considering the value. Portions are quite generous.

The wings are crispy and strip's too.

The burgers are great and fresh, full of flavour. Meat is crisp but tender.

Fries are crispy usually unsalted and not greasy.

Order notes are always followed and always plenty of sauces provided.

For quality locally available fried chicken I would definitely recommend Dixy Chicken in this location. Thanks I ordered from Dixy through Justeat and was pretty disappointed. The food wasn't up to mark – it wasn't hot, and the freshness was definitely lacking. The mini burger was a soggy mess because the bun just didn't seem fresh at all. Also, the corn on the cob had this weird, off taste that I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it wasn't good. Overall, not a great experience this time around.",0.6,0.4,"[""Burger"", ""Fast Food""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['chicken', 'sizzler', 'fresh', 'fresh hot', 'fries', 'hot', 'soggy', 'fried chicken', 'bun', 'crunchy']","[""fried chicken"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""fries"", ""Service"", ""fresh hot"", ""Food Quality"", ""chicken"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""hot"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""fresh"", ""bun"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Fast Food"", ""crunchy"", ""sizzler"", ""soggy"", ""Burger"", ""Experience""]"

I just about found a table for two of us as it was quite a busy time.

Service was generally good. I had a flat white which is usually my standard coffee shop order, and it was decent. Lots of lovely looking cakes and pastries but I wasn't hungry so didn't try them. Stopped by this coffee shop for a quick caffeine fix. The staff was friendly and welcoming, which made for a pleasant experience. The coffee itself was great, but I wish they offered a larger cup size or at least the option for one. Overall, a nice spot, but if you like a bigger cup of coffee, you might be left wanting more. Lovely staff with lovely food and a nice small-cafe vibe. Charging £6 for a house blend pour over is a crime against humanity however, I get it for nice beans but not for a house blend that’s just too much to be justified!! Great coffee and incredible cakes.

Highly recommend a visit. Honestly, a smashing experience overall. Got two things on the house- as we entered and as we finished. I had the donner gyro which was really nice and fresh and warm. My friend had the mixed grill which they enjoyed tasted the best when the lemon was drizzled all over it for the added moisture. Service was amazing there. Notably, Jerusalem was an absolute star, super friendly immediately as you walk in, makes sure you’re comfortable, offers exceptional customer service and all in all a lovely beautiful member of staff, she really made it such a pleasurable service. The owner was also very friendly and made sure everything was okay greeted us and said bye when we departed. I would highly recommend!!! As a Turk, we chose this place to experience a Greek restaurant for the first time. Even though we went on a weekend around 4-5 PM, the place wasn’t very crowded; only 1-2 tables were occupied. The staff greeted us warmly and were very attentive. The portions of the food were generous, and the flavors were good, though I wouldn’t say they were exceptional. Along with the meal, we were offered complimentary meze, börek, pide, dessert, and a small shot-sized drink. Overall, I was satisfied. I visited after a visit to hippodrome, the service was excellent. Staff were so friendly ,the food was perfect. Delicious beef stiffado ,so tender and the desserts were incredible!!!!! We took 2 desserts home for dinner tomorrow.Highly recommend to visit . This is the most underrated place in Birmingham.

The friendly service, the decor, the music, the vibe, the freebies, THE FOOD!!! Honestly it’s so addictive I’ve started to order it takeaway. Feels like a hug and the price can’t be beaten!!!

Staff mixing up coffees, my cortado is almost the size of latte. Staff refusing to serve in glass saying that an hour before closing they only serve in paper cups to drink in.

Once in a while for a treat is fine.  Prices are not suited to full-time students and the choices of food is limited for me as most are non-Halal.

For £3.25 I just don't think I'll go back. I did mention it, and apparently they use a temperature gauge but in my opinion they should heat the milk last, not leave it to stand for 3 mins while they complete the rest of the transactions. I haven't had this occur with other Costa outlets.

Very quiet and peaceful atmosphere by the channel. The decor of the place is super cool and authentic.

The food came in a timely manner and it was of the right temperature and it tasted delicious. The only hiccup was that I washed for hollandase sauce to be on the side instead of the top of my eggs but they misunderstood and gave me an extra Hollandese sauce. Despite that I still enjoyed the food.

It was all absolutely delicious. The ‘chips’ served with the roe were so good no other chip will ever be the same again. The atmosphere was lovely and relaxed with a great eclectic playlist. The staff was delightful and we loved watching the chefs hard at work in the open plan kitchen. We spent £170 including two drinks each, cheese board and tip. Very reasonable for a fine dining experience that in my opinion was as good as some of the Michelin starred restaurants I’ve been to. Well worth it for a special occasion. Thanks HK team! Amazing staff and amazing food. Went to celebrate my graduation and they made it so special, I can’t thank them enough :) Very nice restaurant serving upscale British cuisine. We went there during the week so it was rather quiet, which we actually prefer. The restaurant has a nice bar in the front of the house, where you can enjoy a range of interesting and imaginative cocktails, but they serve classics too. The restaurant part is at the back and you pass an open plan kitchen with bar seats as well, where you can see all the master preparation, it's really interesting! There are normal tables as well obviously, further back.
We had a tasting menu with wine pairing. I really enjoyed the finger food that comes before the main menu, but all dishes were great. Some interesting matches, but also some surprisingly simple dishes like a pasta with butter, truffle and cheese, were absolutely delicious, and nicely paired with the wine. You can taste the quality of ingredients, and masterful preparation just completes the dish. The service is impeccable, friendly and knowledgeable. The sommelier was particularly good, clearly knowing his trade, but also very approachable and nice to talk to.
The whole menu comes to about 8 or 9 dishes, so it's a lot, and we struggled a bit to finish it all!
The experience was very good and I can definitely recommend it. My partner and I attended on a Saturday evening to celebrate her upcoming birthday. My partner is Gluten Free, and Harborne Kitchen went out of their way to accommodate that dietary requirement.

We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we stepped in. We were greeted by all the staff and even the chefs all said allow as we walked by the pass to our seat.

We both went for the tasting menu. And I had the wine pairing. The food was exceptional. Beautifully presented, and each plate was introduced to us by one of the chefs. There are one or two reviews on here complaining about portion size. I think the problem here is common with a taster menu. Especially the Malloreddus. That dish was so good. I wanted to get a big big bowl of it, change into my fat pants, sit on my sofa, and scoff the lot. We were both waddling out of the restaurant after, so there are no complaints from us about portion size.

My only criticism is the tomato course, which is literally a slice of tomato with a couple of onions chucked on. Served with a little bit of stock. I can't understand why it is on a taster menu at a fine dining restaurant.

The decor was nice. The atmosphere was very pleasant. Good vibes all round. And we appreciated the birthday wishes with a chocolate treat. Thank you, Harborne Kitchen. We will definitely be back soon 😋 Amazing! The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was incredible - all the staff were very attention and knowledgeable, Sim in particular was incredibly lovely! We did the 5 for £55 menu which was 100% worth it, each course was absolutely delicious. A few of my friends are vegan and so had the vegan menu and also really enjoyed those courses - although they did comment that they thought some of the courses could have done with a sauce of some kind.

We ended up staying nearly to the end. What a wonderful place. Beer was good and well priced , the bar staff were a dream. I’m sorry I didn’t get the name of the young lady working that day but she was wonderful. Nothing was to much trouble. She even found a phone charger as we were out longer than we planned and I needed my phone for my train ticket. I have dietary issue so didn’t try the food but they did not mind us bringing something in for me to eat. I cannot praise this bar enough and if we lived closer it would be our home from home. Looking forward to the next visit Staff were lovely! Drinks were even better! Atmosphere was top notch. Good place if you like beer. Great place if you also like a fully stocked bar. Great location. Some pretty good offers too. Nice idea, I guess but with staff having to be present to make cocktails etc. And the taps being fobby a normal bar makes more sense really.",1.0,0.0,"[""Italian"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Special Occasion""]","['bar', 'beer', 'pour', 'concert', 'staff', 'bar staff', 'beers', 'phone', 'decided', 'card']","[""phone"", ""Italian"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""concert"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""beers"", ""beer"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""bar"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""pour"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""staff"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""card"", ""decided"", ""Vietnamese"", ""Special Occasion"", ""Value"", ""bar staff"", ""Experience""]"

Aldi consistently delivers great value for money with its wide range of quality products at low prices. The store layout is straightforward, making shopping quick and efficient. I especially appreciate their weekly Specialbuys and fresh produce section. Staff are friendly and efficient at the checkout, helping to keep queues short. Overall, it’s an excellent choice for budget-conscious shoppers who don’t want to compromise on quality. I like this Aldi on Edgbaston Road. The store is generally tidy, well-stocked, and offers really reasonable prices-great for a budget shop! The staff are friendly and the location is convenient, especially if you’re near Cannon Hill Park. My only suggestions would be to improve the tea section (there’s not a huge variety, and it can be hard to find what you’re looking for) and to work on the overall merchandising, as some aisles feel a bit cluttered. Despite that, I’ll definitely be back and will be posting some photos next time to share my finds! I only use this branch when I'm heading to the Cricket over the road. It's your typical Aldi, and it's handy for filling up on snacks and drinks on a match day, but when it gets very busy in there, they only open one till or maybe two, so the queues can build up. There is an ample car park which I've never used, but I would imagine there will be some restrictions in place so cricket spectators don't try to use it for free parking. Staff are just sooooo rude
And unfortunately they seem to.be of the opinion theyre above the customer.  How wrong , how rude.

Perhaps staff training ON MANNERS wouldn't go amiss.

Dusgraceful.

I'll not use the awful store again. Aldi is a fantastic supermarket that offers unbeatable value for money. Their wide selection of products, from fresh produce to household essentials, is of high quality and comes at affordable prices. The store layout is well-organized, making it easy to navigate and find what you need quickly. The staff is friendly and helpful, ensuring a pleasant shopping experience.

Rooms are in desperate need of overhaul and renovation, really dated decor and grubby in places. Otherwise breakfast was good and staff were friendly and helpful. Definitely in no rush to stay here again anytime soon, however after a future renovation I'd be happy to visit again. Ideal location.  In China Town, a short walk from station. Reception staff were friendly and efficient.  Room fairly small but adequate and well appointed.
I had breakfast on 1st morning and the lady couldn't have been more helpful.  But, the quality of the cooked food left much to be desired.  Barely Luke warm. Bacon like cardboard. I'm guessing the chef cooked everything off at 6am and went back to bed leaving all to congealed and solidify for the next 4 hours.  Not 3* standard by any means. Evening food bland.
Muzac in common area very annoying The room was quite small, and the facilities were somewhat dated and not very clean. Breakfast was included, but the options were limited and the quality could be improved.
On a positive note, the location is within walking distance from the station, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Clean, comfy room.  Modern.  Trendy. Well situated.  AMAZING breakfast.  Wonderful staff.  Way better than any IBIS I've stayed in and totally exceeded expectations. Well done.  Enjoyed my stay and would be back in a heartbeat. Well done! We were very disappointed with our experience, the main issue being the quality not meeting the price of the stay.

The entrance was dark and there was a strong cigarette smell.

Our room was worn out, poorly decorated and seemed almost neglected. seems like some redecorating needs to take place. i have attached photographs of the state of the room. Bedding wasn’t clean, many hairs found and mattress was uncomfortable. Didn’t have a pleasant nights sleep, although there was a fan in the room which made the heat bearable.

During breakfast, we were warmly greeted by staff. Food was fine with good options.

He has been in recruitment for many years  and it shows as he is amazing at what he does.  I can't recommend them highly enough. I just wanted to write a brief review as I have just received my official offering in writing for my new job.

During the time that I have been looking for a new role, I have been in contact with several recruitment 'specialists' and Alexander Chapel are in a different league to the rest, on almost all levels.

The level of communication with the team was excellent  and above and beyond my expectations.
I found the interview preparation meetings that you offered me to be highly beneficial along with the advice that was given in between my fist and second interview.

I feel that your expert advice and support has given me the opportunity to secure one of the best roles I have ever been offered and I would highly recommend your company to anyone who is looking to develop their career.

Thank you Never dealt with a recruitment agency before so wasnt sure what to expect but Mark has been super helpful from start to finish. Not a bad word to say and very friendly too.

Absolutely love the avocado shake at Joe & The Juice! 🥑💚 It’s super thick, creamy, and perfectly balanced in flavour not too sweet just right! The texture is so smooth and satisfying, and the portion is generous too.
Totally hits the spot every time. If you love avocado, this shake is a must try! 🙌 Words cannot quantity the Stella customer service that I experienced today. Grace, Decorum, Kindness and Warmth are a but a few words that come to mind when I recount my time at Birmingham New Street, Joe and the Juice earlier today.

I will be sure to visit when I pass through Birmingham again again. It's a pity that 6 stars isn't an option! I had been to this location before for an eat-in experience and left quite satisfied, so I was genuinely surprised and disappointed by how far the quality fell during my recent Pick Up order via de J&J app.

While the the service was reasonably quick despite a busy period, that was the only positive note. The main letdown was the Lavender Matcha Oat Latte. It looked off from the start — nothing like how it’s marketed, lacking the signature vibrant green and lavender tones. In terms of taste, it was even worse: overly milky with barely any presence of matcha or lavender syrup. These are supposed to be the core ingredients of the drink, yet they were either added in negligible amounts or of such poor quality they failed to register, especially the matcha. The drink was bland, diluted, and uninspiring.

The only saving grace in my meal was the Steak Sandwich, which I did enjoy nonetheless. But unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to redeem the experience. Considering the premium prices, I expected consistency and quality. Instead I received a subpar beverage and overall disappointing order. This visit reflect a lack of quality control and poor attention to the brand’s usual standards.

I don’t recommend this location, particularly for takeaway. It falls to live up to the standards set by other branches. The drink me and my friend got was actually really nice, but wow the prices nearly gave me a heart attack 😭 definitely on the pricey side for what it is.

I have been coming to this clinic almost 4 years know. I can’t recommend Courthouse clinic highly enough. The staff are so polite, caring and very professional. Always giving me the right advice and help. The atmosphere is very warm and welcome every time I visit the clinic. The receptionist’s Helen and Jane are amazing, caring and very helpful.  The therapists I have my treatment done by is a lady called Ansari. She is very knowledgeable and professional, makes my treatment very relaxing. I recommended this clinic to my mum, who is also a regular client. Amazing staff and therapists, thank you for all your support. Best Clinic in Birmingham!.. x This is my first clinic visit and i must say, it will certainly wont be my last because all of what i experience was AMAZING. The staff are the best. They are so friendly and hospitable. My physician had a smashing personality. She radiated a very friendly and positive attitude which makes me feel comfortable in each and every visit. Each treatment and products are thoroughly explain so i could have a good understanding. after each session, the would reach out to me to check in which is so good. I want to say thanks to each and every member of staff for making my experience breath taking. Several family members have been coming to this clinic for over ten years and when I recently joined, I felt extremely welcomed. I find my therapist, Norelle really comfortable to be around, she always checks on me throughout the procedure and is very efficient. Helen on reception is also great, as a university student I have restricted time for appointments, only on weekends when I’m home. Helen is so accommodating and always tries to squeeze me in! I love the relaxed environment you all create and am loving the results of the laser treatment!!! I couldn't recommend this clinic highly enough. I was very nervous to have botox for the first time but the staff there were so friendly and really helped to put me at ease. The doctor I saw explained everything well and I am over the moon with the results of the treatment. The staff called me a couple of days later to check how I was after my treatment and I really felt that I was in the hands of professionals. I will definitely be returning. Friendly, caring and professional advice followed by a fantastic treatment. Very happy with my decision to contact Courthouse. I was made to feel so welcome by all the staff.

Always a pleasure to visit Asha’s Birmingham, Food is always superb!
Shahan was our waiter for the afternoon and was attentive and very helpful. He was superb in recommending Summer cocktails and I loved my Raspberry Summer mix “Rickshaw Fizz” The staff were amazing, very kind and welcoming. Very professional. Decor was very nice, unfortunately the food was not amazing. It was nice. Just disappointing for the price. I was expecting some amazing Indian cuisine experience. Unfortunately we were disappointed. It had been a very nice experience, however sadly we would not return. Absolutely blew me away! As far as Indian fine dining goes, this place is a total winner.

The food was just incredible. Seriously, every dish was a hit, but the Gosht Yakhni Biryani was out of this world – so fragrant and the lamb was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The Prawn Shan E Nisha was packed with flavour, and the Lobster Panchphoran? Pure luxury and perfectly spiced.
Beyond the fantastic food, the whole dining experience was amazing. The atmosphere was spot-on, and the service was top-notch. And a massive shoutout to Shubham! That espresso martini he made me was hands down the best I've ever had.

If you're looking for an Indian meal that's a cut above the rest, Asha's is a must-visit. You won't be disappointed! Nice place, atmosphere was good, service & staff was very cordial and good. Nice deco inside, well spaced.
It's a pricey one though.
Food was good, surprisingly despite eating non spicy Malai Paneer &  roti faced GERD, not sure why.
Qnty is good.
Do suggest to others to try their cuisines. Had the executive lunch.
The mint chutney, rice, panner all were awesome

Service is also wonderful and top notch.

Only thing they should have is one veg maharashtrian dish x 365 days.

It’s especially known for its ramen and bento, reasonably priced and quite popular, so expect a queue during peak hours. The interior has the vibe of a small Japanese eatery. The Asian staff are polite and attentive. Seating is a bit tight but still fairly comfortable.

🍣 Salmon Combo Plate & Nigiri Sushi Set B
Not the freshest sushi I’ve had, and the presentation was rather plain, but portions were generous and satisfying. With more refined plating, it could be even better.

🍱 Children’s Bento
Served in a fun, train shaped tray that immediately caught the kids’ attention! Includes fried chicken, prawn, rice ball, tamagoyaki, fruit, and a cup of apple juice. Well balanced and filling, the kids were delighted!

🍜 Mount Fuji Giant Prawn Ramen
Comes with two large fried prawns and dumplings. Even though the fried items were soaked in the soup, they stayed flavorful. The tonkotsu broth was rich and aromatic without being overly salty.

🍹 Melon Cream Soda
A nostalgic Japanese treat! Classic melon soda with a scoop of ice cream. Tastes great and perfect for photos.

🆗 Chicken Gyoza As someone who’s been to Japan, the food here is actually authentic!! I come all the time and the quality of both the food and service is always amazing. Highly recommend :) absolutely amazing service and I love the food, second time coming and I love it every time. super nice waiters/waitresses. I love the atmosphere with the fairy lights and wooden furniture. 1000% recommend Mount Fuji is a Japanese restaurant, and since my friend and I love ramen, we ordered the tonkotsu ramen. Honestly, it was just average—I’d give it a 65 out of 100. What was really disappointing was that when we ordered, the staff told us they had run out of chashu for all ramen dishes… and this was right when they had just opened for the day.

The broth lacked depth and richness, which was a letdown. The gyoza and chicken were decent, and the takoyaki was actually pretty good. Mount Fuji Review: Authentic Japanese Flavors in the Heart of Birmingham

The staff at this location — particularly Harwinder and Adil Suleman — were not only unhelpful but also openly disrespectful and engaged in blaming one another instead of resolving the issue.

I was misled into signing up for a 2-year scheme tied to a phone EMI based on credit checks, only to later discover the information provided was completely bogus. This not only wasted my time but also risked my financial standing. The lack of accountability and customer care is shocking. It’s disheartening to see a once-respected brand tarnished by such unprofessional individuals and poor management.

I truly wonder how such staff can sleep peacefully knowing they’re mishandling customers’ hard-earned money and trust. If this is the new standard of service, it’s clear the brand no longer values its customers. Was on the phone with my autistic sister as she visited the bullring Vodafone store. She was served by Saba who she told that she was autistic and was spoken to in the most horrible manner. My sister explained she didn't understand and was told that she can't make it any clearer for her or offer any more support. Horrible attitude and service from her and made my sister feel very unwelcomed. 0/10 When I first visited the Vodafone shop, they informed me that I could get a SIM-card on a postpaid plan. After three months, I would be eligible for a phone plan. However, when I returned after three months, they told me that my credit history was not sufficient for a phone plan. This felt misleading; it is unfair to tell customers they can receive a phone plan when there is still a credit history check involved.

I had already mentioned that I am new to the country and have no direct debits in my name. Despite this, they insisted that I take the SIM plan, which is quite expensive compared to other companies. For instance, I bought a plan for my wife from EE for just £13 per month, while I am paying £22 per month and still do not have a phone plan.

The staff member there told me to try again after another three months, which further reinforces how misleading the initial information was. I was excited about getting a phone plan after three months, and my wife and I even chose the phone’s storage and color. In the end, however, my credit history was declined, leaving me without a phone plan.

I need this issue to be addressed as soon as possible. I was hopeful about obtaining the phone plan, and now I feel frustrated. If this situation cannot be resolved, I would like to port my plan to EE. Very very terrible staff. My former phone was stolen and I went to change a sim. He just told me to take a phone contract which last two years. And didn’t tell me it only can be cancelled in 14 days. Now I have to pay every month. If you can use other network, just run! My experience with Vodafone was extremely disappointing. Their customer service was completely unprofessional and rude. Not only did they fail to resolve my issue, but they also spoke to me in a disrespectful and insulting manner. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable from a major company.

Siddique mohammed khan Absolutely A1 service today from the girls at Birmingham Bull Ring. So amazingly helpful! Purchased a dress that they did not have in stock to be delivered next day for a very special event :) Went in to try on dresses after visiting the Reiss concession in selfridges and being shown some lovely dresses by a fantastic team member there. She did pick out some lovely dresses for me with one still popping jntj my head when shopping later in the day which I never even looked at when I first arrived on the concession.
Tried them on in the main store instead of in selfridges as I first went round all the shops in Bullrjng to see which options on dresses I had before trying any on.
Sadly the one dress I thought would be the best colour for me (which it was) they didn't have my size available in the store for me to try on. They did get me the same style of dress in the right size but in a different colour to try on and if it was right they offered to offer it for me in the store that day. Sadly I did need the dress in the right colour to try on as the other colour I tried just didn't look right so I couldn't get the best option from trying that on.
Will try to come back when I'm working in town next week to order the dress, both the team members that helped me on the concession and in the store where amazing and very helpful when I was looking around. I just only apologise I couldn't buy the dress because of it not being available in the stores at the time. Would be very happy to come back again and shop to both the store and concession if these two team members are working there.

After purchasing a top and a bag at the self-checkout, I noticed a label on the bag that said something like “secure tagged.” I approached a staff member near the self-checkout area and politely asked if the item still had a tag, as I didn’t want the alarm to go off when leaving the store.

Rather than checking or offering assistance, she responded in a rude manner, telling me to get in the queue. The queue was very long, with only one staff member serving many customers, most of whom were making returns, so it took a long time for me to be seen.

Eventually, when I reached the till, I was asked to step aside while a male colleague was radioed. He brought me back to the self-checkout, scanned the item, and confirmed there was no tag on it. He apologized for the experience, but by that point, I had only a few minutes left to get to work.

I had made my purchase with plenty of time to spare, but the lack of assistance and the dismissive attitude of the initial staff member caused a significant and unnecessary delay. I found her unwillingness to help extremely frustrating and unprofessional.

I am very disappointed by the service I received and hope this feedback will be used to improve the customer experience at this store. The query at the fitting room is quite long and very discouraging, they need a larger space because of the crowd that comes into the store, it tends to make the place crowded. They have amazing clothes and very affordable and the quality is very good Love this place, especially now when there is a lot of place.
The shop is nice and bright, fitting rooms are lovely as well.
Self check out is working great Don't buy from Zara online as if you have to return the items they will not refund you the money.
I have confirmation  that item has been delivered to them, but they are claiming that they have not received it.
This capture is from my online account! Great shopping experience. Right im the middle of city centre on the main junction of high street. Had to wait in a long que before entering the store. This explains how much people like it.
The store itself is beautifully decorated and has a Great interior. Consists of multiple floors that segregate mens, women and children clothing. In terms of clothing its has more or less everything to cover all events from formals to casual etc. Shoe variety is a bit of question but again its not a shoe store only. In terms of quality its good. Some products are excellent and prices wise its not bad for the quality.

Clean and inviting with good quality food. Me and my mates came here today for breakfast as we wanted to come away from your typical ‘brunch’ place.

The cafe felt nostalgic and like I was back at my Nan’s getting served up a full English with a proper brew. The lady serving in there is an absolute gem and made us feel so at home - loved the little touch of being called bab.

My night at this so-called ""nightclub"" was nothing short of appalling. From the moment we arrived, we were met with the most unprofessional, arrogant, and downright hostile staff I’ve ever encountered.
The doormen behaved like power-tripping security guards at a prison gate—condescending, cold, and completely full of themselves. They acted as if letting people in was some kind of exclusive privilege they were bestowing upon the unworthy masses. When we approached, they barely looked at us, muttering snide comments under their breath, laughing amongst themselves like a bunch of high school bullies on a power trip.

We came dressed properly, excited for a night out, and had already paid £30 each for entry. But the staff made it clear we weren’t welcome. No explanation. No reasoning. Just the most dismissive and infuriating response: “It’s just how it is tonight.”
That’s not a policy—that’s an insult.

When we tried to get clarification, we were talked over, mocked, and ignored. One staff member even rolled his eyes and walked away mid-conversation like we were beneath him. The attitude was so disgusting, I honestly can’t remember the last time I felt so deliberately disrespected in a place that calls itself a business.

This wasn't just bad service—it was blatant arrogance, unprofessionalism, and a complete lack of human decency. It was like they took pride in ruining people’s nights.

Avoid this place at all costs. There are hundreds of better venues where you're actually treated like a paying customer instead of a nuisance. I will never set foot near this joke of a nightclub again, and I strongly advise anyone with self-respect to do the same We all (12) had the most amazing time at Rosie’s. We booked our VIP area for the afternoon disco and were very well looked after by the amazing team of staff. Thank you for a fantastic day. Only 3/5 rooms open on a Saturday night which was disappointing. Music all quite similar in each room, which was a shame. Got given a voucher to get in for £6 and then got charged £10 as it took so long getting through the complicated security! All booth seating roped off but not in use. Not great to be honest... Okay for a short visit, will say that the drinks weren't too expensive given the setting and location. We went on Saturday 08/02/25 for the comedy club. We had a great night, the comedians and the compere were all excellent. It's a really nice venue and the drinks were good.

I must make a special mention for the security staff. One doorman in particular, was a real credit to your establishment. I am on crutches at the moment, and he could not have been more helpful. He carried one of my crutches and let me use him as a support when getting up the stairs and made sure I found the rest of my party who were already in the venue. At the end of the show, he came straight over to me and escorted me out through a side door, so I didn't have to battle through the crowds. Again, he supported me down the stairs and ensured I didn't fall. In a world where security staff can get a lot of bad press, this guy went way beyond what was expected from him and I am truly grateful. I will definitely be visiting Rosie's again, next time I am in Birmingham and I am recommending it to everyone I talk to. having an absolute best time here ever. my favourite room is retro they play all the best songs and has the best vibes in there. very nicely decorated. bar staff are super friendly and lovely. came to the bar on more than one occasion and had the best service. 100% coming back again",0.8,0.2,"[""Burger"", ""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Communication/Responsiveness"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['security', 'security staff', 'crutches', 'rosie', 'nightclub', 'power', 'night', 'stairs', 'staff', 'best']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Communication/Responsiveness"", ""security staff"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""power"", ""Service"", ""night"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""best"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""security"", ""Location"", ""nightclub"", ""staff"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""stairs"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""crutches"", ""rosie"", ""Value"", ""Burger""]"

Good location, within easy reach from anywhere in the city centre.The place is clean and tidy and offers a good choice in snacks.Ordered coffee, and it was ok. Resisted the sweet stuff this time.All good; I will go for more. I visited this café with a friend of mine and the service was not the greatest to put it nicely. Very rude staff.
First of all, the bun that I had ordered was very dry and was lacking in the flavour department.
The chai latte was appalling, it tasted like straight up sweet milk - I would not recommend this especially if you are cultured. There was no spice whatsoever.
The mushroom pastry was decent yet very, very greasy.
And lastly, there was some form of cronut that we had ordered that was so hard and tough to get into - you’d need a chainsaw just to cut it up! Originally we thought we’d take this dessert to go, yet shortly changed our minds. A couple of minutes after, the manager decided to berate us for eating that one dessert in (bearing in mind everything else we had ordered to eat in). Never had a staff member assume the worst like that before and humiliate us for no apparent reason like that in our lives - would never go back! Even after the ordeal, she would keep giving us evils and dirty looks until we left.

In summary, this bakery/café is all show and not all that good in reality. Very much an Instagram vs reality moment - I would only recommend if you’re into being scolded/humiliated and dry pastries! Overpriced hipster place. Price does not match quality unfortunately. Very dry and chewy pastries. Staff could be more polite and welcoming. Will only be visiting again with a free voucher.

Beautiful food, tasty fresh and great location for the Hippodrome Booked at short notice for a Friday evening 4.45pm . There was only a few people in there and very quiet but within 30mins the place filled up and the atmosphere got busy.
We ordered wine, Greek Salad and our main meals , Mousska and a Beef Stifado. The food was absolutely amazing, taking us right back to the greek holidays.
We would definitely recommend this place as a fantastic place to eat. Avoid this ""Greek Restaurant"" , food are without any taste and old,NOTHING FRESH THERE TRUST ME!!!!! A bottle of beer cost me £8 , the food was absolutely disgusting,nothing similar with Greek food, paid £55 for nothing ... Be aware if you love your health !!! Really quick service prior to going to a show at the Hippodrome. Served within 5 minutes. Really good food. Staff very friendly and chatty. Plus a shot and baklava on the house at the end So I was advised not to go to Santorini, so after lots of searching for somewhere for my sister's Hen Night I booked Athens.
Little did I know that when we arrived if was infact Santorini.  Not a good start when some of the Hens had had bad experiences at Santorini.
Anyhow, we arrive after I had booked it over 3 months ago for the table not to be ready (felt like we were not booked).
Tables set for a group of originally 26 but was for 24.  We were crammed in so setting the tables up with activities for the night it was a challenge.all the seat covers were minging and very dirty.

Before the guests had arrived food had been placed on the tables all with  small plates.
Stupidly we thought that we would eat what was on the table, have a break and then onto the mains... how wrong was I... the food kept coming with nothing to serve the food out with, so we were all double dipping.
The food was lovely however we all sat down and 7.40 and food was all out by 8.30.  Most of the food was wasted which is awful in this day and age.  We were offered boxes to take away but how could we, the food had been double if not quadruple dipped and left out for hours.
Drinks service was a joke too we waited ages to be served and when they arrived most drinks were forgotten.
I had travelled from Cannock for this special night and had spent many hours preparing, but was totally let down.  The floor was slippy and two of the guests had slipped badly on the floor and when deserts came, there was no additional plates nor forks or spoons it was a case of hands only.
The tables were full of plates, glasses etc to the point we moved them onto the sides to be able to access the tops of the tables.
Finally, the night was over by 10pm and we were been headed to pay.  We'll what was supposed to be £25.00 each some of us were charged 27.50... the owner wanted us to pay for service so he could pay his staff. This is what he said to me on several occasions.

I feel this place falsely advertises and offer the world when you look at the website.  I was expecting a late night but after arriving for the 7.30pm booking we had all left at 10.30pm.  The DJ was supposed to start at 11pm but that was oviousley not right as all hen parties had left around the same time.  Downstairs had a few people in but apart from.that it was obvious that the night had ended.

I'm gutted as the experience was utterly shocking.  The food was lovely and I feel that the chefs are been let down as the food was really nice but due to the service been poor and rushed with no change of plates nor serving cutlery it was sad.
Finally the floor is slippery and two.of the guests fell and one has had to.go to A&E die.to the fall and once reporting the fall the owner dismissed it and said he didn't see her fall but he has cameras.  No accident book!!!  Also when the plates were smashed those on the dance floor were close to the action and one.of.our guests foot was cut by a plate when it was smashed

Absolutely a gentleman and deserves all the praise he gets. We would happily return every time if the service is as grand as this. Absolutely blown away. Definitely recommend this place! Drinks are lovely but the staff are wonderful. I don't know the names unfortunately but extra thankyou to the fancy man in the Hawaiian shirt! Very informative about different drinks, super helpful getting chairs for me and my friend who are disabled. Also a lovely girl who just had an excellent vibe. It was on the evening of April 3rd if that helps 😂 xx Monday night is comedy night - free admission to some great comedy 19:30-21:30. Wonderful pub. Great service, very friendly staff and the Mad Goose beer is fantastic. An absolute must for anyone visiting Birmingham City Centre . Myself and a few friends went here for a few drinks and a catch-up and the Vic ticked all of the boxes. It was easy to get drinks, and chat.

I honestly didn't think vegan food could taste this good! Went for Sunday Lunch and it was delightful. Very quick and friendly table service, food arrived swiftly and are huge portions for the price. I very much recommend this place for a nice meal or raven just a coffee in the chilled ambience. I hosted an event here yesterday and the host was so kind, he thought about every detail, went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and even found a friend to introduce Iftar with a beautiful prayer. The food was delicious and all my guests went away happy and contented. Thanks everyone at BRIG! Warehouse Cafe has been on my agenda for a long, long time! I'm not vegan but have had spells of it in the past and had heard the food here was delicious and I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed at all! Considering the pandemic and the weight of restrictions facing many places, especially independents, I was ao impressed by the quality of the food! It may just look like burger and chips but wow... thkse chips are some of the best I've had - anywhere! They are so light and crispy, and lightly seasoned with herbs, soft in the middle... I ordered more! Then you get to the burger, perfectly toasted brioche with this amazing burger which was unlike any bean-type burger I've had before... with the melted vegan cheese that ACTUALLY tasted like cheese... this wicked sauce and fresh salad... with a fantastic vegan mayo dipping sauce... absolutely brilliant 👌🏾🔥 and the vegan oreo brownie... 🤤🤤🤤 can't wait to go back!!! This cafe/vegan restaurant is really a gem! The burger was fantastic, one of the best I’ve had around!
It’s a very chill, relaxing environment with a friendly staff.
They have a great menu with options for all different plant based eaters, including desserts at the counter, drinks and specials. The food tasted fresh, was very flavourful and very well presented. It was also a really good amount of food for the price. I would definitely recommend checking it out! The Warehouse Cafe is a gem in digbeth. Their vegan style banana blossom fish and chips & Vegan Kebab burger and chips meals were fantastic! They have a great variety of craft beers available and a wonderful selection of homemade cakes too. The Cafe's interior is pretty basic; there are sofas with a bookcase at one end of the room and basic chairs and tables around the rest of the room. This creates a relaxed environment but I can see how this would people off from visiting!

The service was excellent as well. The owner was incredibly kind. Amazing and super friendly place! Felt very welcome from the moment we walked in. Highly recommend!!

Myself and some friends did their bottomless brunch for £28 which was an amazing deal! Staff really looked after us and kept us topped up throughout. Any game we wanted to play they set up for us and gave helpful advice. We paid the £2 an hour afterwards to keep playing as we'd found some games we really enjoyed. So many games to pick from! Even a switch on site is free to use!

Couldn't fault the place for the pieces we paid!! Lovely little cafe, the is a large selection of games of multiple styles and genres so plenty to choose from!

The food is a really good portion size and great value for money alongside being super tasty.

And to top it all off the owner Adam is lovely and nothing is ever too much trouble for them - always look forward to my visits to the cafe! Popped in on my pub trail. Not really a beer drinking place. They had a small selection of canned beers in the fridge. Of which I had one. Good beer but a little pricey. Place was nice and the staff were friendly. Ok place for board games if your in to that sort of thing. Still I enjoyed my visit. A fantastic place to talk and play games with a bunch of friends.

Lots of parking available on grounds (pay via machine/app) lots of indoor and outdoor seating and a bar area. Menu was great,  however, limited vegetarian options were noted by a friend. Her meal was delicious though. Quality of food 5/5.

Live music was a fantastic surprise (Friday evening).Staff were very warm and accommodating. Toilets are upstairs and decorated beautifully.

The place has held its beautiful historic ambience with a romantic air. Larger rooms are available to be hired out for functions. A great place! The Physician is absolutely beautiful and the food is excellent. We decided to eat here for a family meal, which was lovely. Then one the servers - Amber, who wasn't our server - went out of her way to stop and say how beautiful me, my mom and mother-in-law looked just as we were leaving. She asked what the occasion was. It was actually my wedding day! We hadn't told anyone, so this made us very happy that someone had noticed how glowing we were. It was a very happy day for us.

On our next visit, we asked if they could adapt a dish to accommodate a medical need, and they were able to do that for us. The staff are so easy to talk to. The atmosphere is relaxed and we feel very welcomed and comfortable. It's a wonderful experience. Great food and service from the staff. You can tell the food is made with quality ingredients as with all Brunning and Price pubs. They always have interesting and delicious vegan options and a range of great drinks behind the bar. The perfect place to refuel just outside Birmingham City Centre. In the heart of Edgbaston this cosy and well designed pub has ample space for small and large groups.

I like the outdoor covered area and the garden room. But all of the spaces are located around the main bar/lounge area. The service is good and the food is delicious. Portions are not huge, but it’s the quality that really matters here.

Recently I enjoyed the Sunday beef roast. A colleague recommended The Physician to us and she wasn't wrong! Beautiful old building in Edgebaston Village, and it feels special when you walk through door. Massive bar area with a buzz of conversation, and an equally massive range of drinks. As soon as we said that we had a dinner reservation, we were shown to our table.

Daily menus were given to us and we were offered drinks. The menu is extensive, covering a wide range of cuisines. My wife had fish and chips, and it was perfectly cooked, with pure white flakey fish.  I chose the braised neck of lamb, with veg and gravy. Fabulous, and the lamb just melted in the mouth. The portion sizes were generous and the prices seemed about right.

Not a service i expected as I usually order from here. Very disappointed.

The restaurant itself has a casual feel and the doors open to the street in summer, I can imagine it’s lovely.
The food was spectacular. All expectations were exceeded. The small plates are varied and there are lots of vegetarian options. Each dish was fresh and flavourful. Service also excellent.
Definitely returning again I’m so sad I didn’t enjoy the pasta here. I’d heard mixed reviews, and was still wanting to give it a fair chance but unfortunately disappointed. The focaccia was delicious, and the goats cheese / beetroot ravioli  was good, but the main pasta dishes were disappointing. I had the crab devon and my mum had the carasecce which in my opinion was undercooked. The crab Devon pasty was too fishy for me, and the carasecce was bland. The paparadelle had okay flavours , but nothing special. The dessert, was genuinely inedible, the poached rhubarb was still so hard, the nut praline didn’t have a great aftertaste and the sauce was very tart. I felt the flavours didn’t compliment at all even if it had been cooked properly. I would be keen to try the food again, and give it a second chance as I was so looking forward to eating authentic freshly made pasta. Visited Trentina twice now and it’s a lovely, cosy Italian spot in the Jewellery Quarter.

I’ve done both bottomless brunch and a regular dining visit and couldn’t recommend both enough!

Service is always excellent and attentive by staff. Carafes of water are regularly refilled and drinks take no time to come out at all.

The pasta is the real star here, though. Handmade on-site (seriously, if you walk past early enough you can see the magic happen!) and always tasty. I’ve only knocked off a star for food as last time I came my spaghetti was a bit on the undercooked side. Could have done with just one more minute or two to make it perfectly al dente!

If you haven’t been to Trentina, you’re not doing Brummie Italian food right. What a perfect start to my day.  Greeted and seated by the lovely max who was very attentive great all round welcoming service (my coffee was perfect really enjoyed it)
I was recommended the hispi cabbage which was absolutely mouth watering unreal flavours very very yummy great amount of chilli oil and the cheese yum yum yum!! 10/10 from me!
I also had lamb maltagliati I have no words WOW YUMMY SCRUMPTIOUS absolutely lovely presentation and taste for both dishes was on point , I will definitely recommend and urge you to have a taste!

The store owner was absolutely lovely, helped me and my disabled friend without any need to ask. Food and drink amazing, store has a great selection of singles and a massive play area downstairs Usually not very busy and should be able to find a seat downstairs. Most players come for card games or board games.

The foods are fair. Of course it is not a restaurant, so do not expect a high quality. If for some quick treats, the foods should be more than enough. As someone who visited the old Geek Retreat site a few times nearer the city center (and saw some of it's not so great moments). I can honestly say the staff, atmosphere and new location is a lot better now that they have moved to the Jewellery Quarter.

Staff seem a lot more friendler and knowledgeable, and provide good customer service. And the atmosphere, location, and products on offer feel a lot better.

They have a good variety of card games, board games, t-shirts, and other merchandise to buy upstairs. Then downstairs is a free console playing area and free gaming tables for playing your own card and board games (though some tables maybe reserved for events). There is even a few free card and board games available for use downstairs too.

I didn't try the food at the old or new location, but from what I have seen they try and offer a good variety of snacks and quick food and drink to keep you going while gaming. If you want proper food or have special requirements - there are lots of pubs, restaurants, cafes etc nearby that may server better food if you want a proper meal beforehand.

I have visited twice. Once to look around and I got a nice Pokémon shirt. Then again to get a pre-release for MTG Wilds of Eldraine, some MTG commander decks, and a nice (now rare!) MTG LOTR playmat.

They have lots of other products though (especially themed around then events they hold).

There are lots of events and casual gaming sessions that look fun to join, and most paid  entry events seem to include a booster pack or a drink.

It is very convenient to have this shop in the Jewellery Quarter, as most geeky shops are in the City Centre or Digbeth. The Jewellery Quarter can be a nice alternative, as it a quieter space with nice architecture, so good for those who don't like crowds/busy areas.

The shop is easy to get to by train and tram (never tried it by bus).

If you get a Daytripper/Network Day Ticket from the bus/tram/train/train stations (it costs around £7.90 after 9:30 am - it includes a days unlimited travel by train, tram, and bus, around most of the West Midlands) you can easily have a look at this shop and other gaming shops in Birmingham to check stock and prices, and have fun around Brum.

My only suggestion to staff is that they need to open a window or put a few air fresheners downstairs, as there is not as much air flow downstairs as there is upstairs. As it is a cellar area, it just needs something to help it out when it gets a bit musty. i came once with a friend and now make weekly trips there with my partner because i love it so much Shops okay guys are nice. Whatever you do, do not book pre orders with them. They will give your pre orders away even if you call a couple days prior. When you pre order they will not say anything about pre payment. When you check a couple weeks in advance they won't mention pre payment or prioritising local players.  When you come in the week before they'll tell you you are high up on the list and will get something but when the time comes they will give your product away

Service was quick. Really nice atmosphere, not too loud even when it's busy.   Certain tables have a lot of space for prams, which footfall isn't as heavy which is perfect.
Food was cooked perfectly and full of flavours I visited this place a few times and haven't had any complaints about the cuisine. The food is average to good, however, some dishes are quite expensive for what you get in terms of portion size.
It's a posh place and that's what you're paying for; the location, decor and ambience.
Last visit was with a reservation and the place was absolutely packed. The customer service at the entryway was polite, and we were seated immediately.
Once ordered, the food arrived quickly and all was good with that. As we finished off drinks and the table was being cleared, the manager asked us to leave because there were people waiting. However, it was us that were waiting for dessert, which was taking a long time to arrive as they forgot about it. The waiter/manager/guy in suit did apologise for rushing us.
Slightly disappointed with the forgetful service, but it happens when you're rushed off your feet and not all staff are ""on the same page"". Extremely disappointing experience — overpriced, underwhelming, and outright rude.

Let’s start with the host. A very tall Black gentleman (only mentioning for identification, as he wore no name tag) was at the entrance. He walked right up to us, saw us waiting, and didn’t even bother to say hello. It wasn’t until I stared directly at him for a while that he finally mumbled a “hello,” as if I had to beg just to be acknowledged. Basic hospitality? Nonexistent.

We were then refused seating in a clearly open section of the restaurant — lights on, people dining, and absolutely no “reserved” signage. When asked why we couldn’t sit there, the answer was vague and dismissive. Instead, we were led to a cramped, uncomfortable spot. The entire interaction felt cold and unwelcoming.

As for the food? Laughably small portions — honestly, I wouldn’t serve this to a dog. At this price point, I expected at least something decent, but the flavors were average at best. You’re paying premium rates for barely edible, forgettable dishes.

Cold service, inflated prices, microscopic portions, and a general attitude that makes you feel like you’re the inconvenience — Fumo is a hard pass. Never returning, and I’d strongly advise others to steer clear The food was wonderful. Attentive and friendly atmosphere & service. Firm favourites are fried sea food with scallops, lobster pasta, and fried pizza Panzerotti. We enjoyed everything we tried, and we come here often and I'm never disappointed with the food. Would 100% recommend. My only criticism is the lobster pasta keeps getting smaller and smaller hoping this improves. We visited on a Saturday evening at around 630pm, we turned up on the off chance without a booking, we were lucky and got a table straight away. The place was busy so do recommend booking before-hand. It's located right at the top floor of Selfridges.

Service was good but had to wait a while for the bill once we were ready to leave. Dishes are 'portion-sized' between a full course & tapas dish. Whilst the menu recommends between 5 to 6 dishes between 2 people - the sizes of portions were good & depending upon how hungry you are, 4 dishes should be ok. We ordered 5 dishes and were so full, couldn't order dessert!

Didn’t see the rooms. Want to go back when they have entertainment on. I don't know where to start...I can only presume that any positive reviews or ratings of these premises must be based on the restaurant rather than the rooms. Everything in this room was filthy. There was evidence of vermin, cockroach traps under the bed, broken sink, torn curtains, the windows do not shut. Smashed windows seen on the outside of the building. The only evidence that this was the same property as the one advertised on the website was the blue piano in the entrance. No staff available after 9pm. Absolutely no way is this a 3 star property. Avoid! An Unforgettable Night of Jazz at The Blue Piano – Friday, 21st March 2025

I had the absolute pleasure of visiting The Blue Piano in Edgbaston, and what an evening it was! I made the trip especially to see the incredibly talented Dr Stephen Tromans perform, and he did not disappoint. From the moment he and the other musicians took the stage, the energy in the room was electric.

The music was nothing short of breathtaking—rich, soulful, and deeply moving. I found myself listening with my eyes closed, heart open, completely lost in the magic unfolding before me. Stephen Tromans plays with such passion and skill; his connection to the music is something truly special. I was absolutely blown away.

The atmosphere at The Blue Piano only enhanced the experience. It’s an intimate and vibrant venue, perfect for live jazz. The warmth of the crowd, the outstanding musicianship, and the sheer beauty of the music made it an evening to remember. The venue’s commitment to showcasing top-quality jazz acts really sets it apart, making it a must-visit for any jazz lover.

I travelled quite a distance just to see Stephen Tromans perform, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. His presence brought something truly special to the venue, and it was clear I wasn’t the only one who felt that way. I really hope The Blue Piano books him again soon—he and the other musicians created an unforgettable experience, and I know many would love the chance to experience it again.

If you love live jazz in a welcoming and atmospheric setting, The Blue Piano is the place to be. I can’t wait to return for another fantastic evening of music! Hotel review:
We couldn't really enjoy our room as there was an event going on at the restaurant and gardens, with loud music directly outside  single glazed windows it was very loud. Luckily it ended just before midnight so we could sleep, although since we'd had to keep the windows closed it was extremely warm.

The rooms are ok but could have been cleaned in more detail, there was a spider web under the windowsill with several dead spiders in it. I was not impressed with the Blue Piano it was cold no atmosphere. Menu on line looked amazing but when we got there we were given  a reduced menu and told they were changing it but unfortunately they didn't let us know, my husband  picked the duck as his main course but the waiter said they didn't have it .What we did have was very very spicy Will not be going  back.",0.4,0.6,"[""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['blue', 'jazz', 'windows', 'music', 'live jazz', 'evidence', 'perform', 'property', 'truly special', 'rooms']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""live jazz"", ""rooms"", ""windows"", ""Service"", ""blue"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""property"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Waiting Time"", ""perform"", ""Cleanliness"", ""jazz"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""evidence"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""music"", ""truly special"", ""Value"", ""Experience""]"

Forgot to take pics of the starters but we had the duck pancakes (to die for!) chicken dumplings, absolutely divine, and cod mini balls, very nice! Came here with my group of friends last evening, had a really good time. The food and service were exceptional. The staff were nice to ask for allergies before hand. There is so much variety here which will make you want to come back to try all of them. Would definitely visit the place again and would recommend to anyone.

We had cocktails and wine, and all were lovely. Lovely restaurant   was my first visit but won't be my last. We visited Banana Tree Birmingham to celebrate a very special little girl’s 9th birthday, and honestly, it turned into such a beautiful, memorable experience—mainly thanks to the amazing staff, Temi and Franklyn.

From the moment we arrived, they both went above and beyond to make her feel like the birthday star she truly is! They helped us keep the cake a surprise, working with us like secret agents until the big reveal—her face absolutely lit up when it came out, candles and all. It was a moment we’ll never forget.

Although the food took a while to come out, that in no way reflects the team. Temi and Franklyn were consistently warm, attentive, and full of positive energy. They checked in on us regularly, kept the birthday girl smiling, and genuinely made us feel looked after.

A big thank you to Banana Tree Birmingham for the lovely atmosphere, and an even bigger thank you to Temi and Franklyn—your kindness made all the difference. We’ll definitely be back! It’s my first meal in Birmingham. I just randomly walked into this restaurant which the area look relaxing and tidy.

I always go for the basic, Pad Thai. We have ordered a chicken pad thai & a chicken fried rice. The presentation of the dishes is very good, the portions are also enough to be not too full which is just right for a dessert. Pad Thai was as expected very delicious.

However, I have no idea what’s going on with the dessert and I have never tried something like this. The texture of the sticky rice was super sticky and the ice cream doesn’t taste nice.

Food is very tasty - I had the mushroom aranchini and the muhammara dip. Both really tasty and so fresh. The aranchini had lovely big bits of mushroom in and the salad with the drip was delicious - plus, given that much of the salad is grown in their rooftop garden, it must be one of the freshest salads in Brum!

The Hive’s commitment to training young people and growing fresh produce is really commendable and the result is a cafe with delicious food! Wandering around the Jewellery Quarter I stumbled across this delightful cafe.  Fresh gorgeous food. I had a cheese and onion tart and a unique salad. I managed to resist the sweets. Stop in for breakfast, lunch or coffee and a treat. My favourite place to eat in the Jewellery Quarter. The food is some of the best I have ever eaten. Homegrown, organic and tasty, the menu is an excellent mix of unique options. The value price is fantastic, with a range of cakes, drinks and snacks.

The staff are warm and kind, offering perfect service every time.

I would rate this place higher if I could. I would recommend it to everyone. The Hive is awesome! They make everything fresh, and it’s all vegetarian with plenty of vegan options too. They even use ingredients from their own urban rooftop garden and micro-farm. You can really taste the difference with their super fresh and seasonal dishes.

I tried the Masala Scotch Egg with homemade salads and pickles, and wow – it was so good! The egg was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spice, and the salads were fresh, colorful, and full of flavour. The team put a lot of thought into every dish, and since they change the menu seasonally, there’s always something new to try.

The staff are super warm and welcoming, and you can tell that they really enjoy what they do. If you’re into delicious, healthy food with a laid-back atmosphere, The Hive is the place to be. Definitely recommend checking it out! Really love this place, it’s organic and vegetarian and the staff are wonderful, special thanks to Jonathan who is always really helpful and accommodating! It’s got beautifully prepared, tasty and healthy food options and beautiful bread and sweet treats.

Food is always good. Wine list caters to all budgets. And they have great seafood dishes.

There are two levels to the restaurant and we were sat at a table tucked away which was great. Lots of mirrors with a ceiling full of artificial roses. It’s over the top but suits the venue and adds to the experience.

Great wine. Lots of Italian choices. We had a couple bottles of the primitivo after a round of negronis (pleased an Italian place can make these well too)

My starter was overdone under the grill. I’ve had the baked aubergine parmagiano many times and this unfortunately wasn’t their best. Monkfish tagliatelle and the shared dessert more than made up for it.

The dessert was three mini portions per person and a limoncello shot for £9 each. Great value.

Will look forward to my next visit. We arrived and had to wait a little while for our table, along with quite a few others, so the entrance area felt a bit crowded.

The espresso martini had a great coffee flavour but lacked the usual punch you’d expect from a classic martini.

The oysters were fabulous—nice and big, just how we like them!

The pizza, unfortunately, was a bit underwhelming. It was light on toppings, which made it lack flavor. We also tried the seafood grill main, which really could’ve used some salt, garlic, and chili to bring it to life.

That said, the restaurant itself is beautiful—great atmosphere and setting. Great food apart from the tomato bruschetta - no flavour and seemed if was rushed it lacked taste but everything else was delish.

The waitress was quite passive aggressive and rude. I wish I didn’t pay the service charge. She was very intimidating. No people skills. Other staff were great. Not a particular fan of UK Italian restaurant as my overall experience of them are not very positive. Did book a table on Sunday night as San Carlo is one of the Birmingham signature restaurants. Didn’t expect much but I do think they did a great job. Food was delicious overall and in generous portions which is a bonus. Calamari was good, freshly fried and still crispy with some squid flavour instead of a rubber in most Italian restaurants. My frutti de mare was good, loads of seafood, probably the pasta is overcooked a bit to my taste. But I like the subtle spicy that bring the dish better. Reasonable service, can see some wear and tear from the decor. Price is reasonable considering the portion is big. Not a exceptional food but definitely a nice one. So the food the bruchetta was almost inedible the bread being hard as a rock.

However the rigatoni alla norma was absolutely fabulous one of the best pasta dishes I have had in a long time and to follow the strawberry merguine cake which rains supreme over any cake I have ever had!

It's a shame that before my dining experience i was kept waiting at the door for 15-20mins while the host was laughing on the phone, it really set the tone for service not being checked on during the the meals or having water poured, this however picked up after my main!

Overall it is a nice reasturant with lovely food but the level of service i received was not worth the price especially when similar reasturant fumo is a short walk and offers a much higher quality and more attentive service!",0.6,0.4,"[""Italian"", ""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Dessert"", ""Seafood"", ""Vietnamese""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone""]","['italian', 'seafood', 'san carlo', 'carlo', 'san', 'martini', 'lacked', 'grill', 'pasta', 'flavour']","[""Italian"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""martini"", ""san"", ""Service"", ""san carlo"", ""Dessert"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""pasta"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Portion Size"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""grill"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""Seafood"", ""seafood"", ""lacked"", ""carlo"", ""Vietnamese"", ""italian"", ""Value"", ""Experience"", ""flavour""]"

I highly recommend trying the matcha one. They make all the desserts themselves, which is amazing and you can really taste the effort they put into creating something truly delicious. The staff is super nice and polite. I hope they open more locations in other cities. My friend has recommended this place for their popular bingsu. The place is cozy, they have both indoor and outdoor seating area.

I’ve ordered a mango bingsu, which the portion is just right for 2 people to share. Not sure if the sauce is condensed milk or something similar, but it’s adding a flavour to the bingsu which really special. Defo worth coming a long way for this bingsu.

For the oreo tiramisu and hojicha cream roll, I was expecting a creamy and smooth texture. But the tiramisu was solid hard like frozen cheesecake. Even the cream roll, the sponge cake wasn’t soft enough. The cream was very thick and not airy as I expected.

Overall, it’s satisfying to enjoy a nice mango bingsu in a cozy indoor cafe. Would recommend to take a seat and chill. ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡ Recommended! So glad we don’t have to travel down to London for great little cakes anymore, I’d say their cakes rival the likes of WA cafe etc. Looking forward to try more flavours! really kind baristas, and good explanation of speciality beans, which change seasonally. The drinks are not too expensive, I spent around £8 for an iced peach matcha latte with a pistachio sea salt matcha cookie.

I came here to study and it had really ambient, calm, jazz music which wasn’t too loud or distracting. It was a Wednesday morning so it wasn’t too busy.

One downside is that there is no toilet or WiFi :( but the food, drinks, kind staff and atmosphere outweigh this!!

it was my second time here and I‘ll keep continuing to come because it is so nice 🥰 Impeccable service in a cozy coffee shop in the heart of Chinatown.
They use and source remarkable coffees from across the UK and Europe. Made with meticulous care it’s a great small shop for those looking for great drinks and a short stop in their busy days.

But we did enjoy the atmosphere and themed music and made the most of it anyway It was a really good venue we attended the drag bingo.

A venue where you feel safe and secure is amazing , the bar staff were friendly , the guys who brought the bottomless drinks to our tables were brilliant .
Would definitely return . Such an amazing night. We went out for a family members birthday and the hospitality provided by Dondre, Ella and Sara was second to none.

Just sharing this hoping hygiene and communication can be improved a bit. Good food, good service and peaceful environment. The guy who working here has good smiley face always and good nature.
All over good experience and highly recommend. Came here on a busy Friday night, I could tell pressures were high. However the one who truly stood out and kept cool, calm and collective was a young boy , I’d say age ranged 19 +. I was stunned at how polite this young superstar was. Having worked in retail on and off for the best part of 30 year I know first hand how stressful things may get. He really came through. Just like to come here and say my piece as I’m so proud to see today’s youth is not failing us.  I think his name is anmol .

We were warmly welcomed by the friendly staff, which made a great first impression.

We ordered the mix platter for three people and waited about 20 minutes for the food to arrive. In the meantime, the restaurant kindly served us a portion of bread with salad, yogurt, and chili sauce  a nice touch! The bread was especially tasty and crispy.

The platter included a generous mix of meats: kebabs, ribs, and wings. Everything was delicious, and the ribs were particularly good. However, I would suggest adding a bit more doner kebab to the platter, as it was very flavorful but not in large enough portions.

Overall, we really enjoyed the food. One minor suggestion: it would have been more convenient if we were provided with spoons for the rice. Also, while the service was friendly, it could have been slightly more attentive.

All in all, we had a pleasant experience and may return if we're in the area again. Honestly I LOVE their food, their succulent Kebabs is done so perfectly and professionally. The chef definitely knows what he’s doing as the meat is so delicious and tender. They’ve got variety of foods to enjoy from and I will keep coming back to this place. The young gentleman that served us was also very friendly and helpful as always!
Thank you for providing such great tastes which makes my heart happy 😊 Highly recommended! Absolutely amazing service, atmosphere and most of all the taste!!

I was extremely disappointed with it. The sausage was incredibly dry, overcooked and cold.  The presentation was also awful. The gentleman (owner) who made the sandwich only buttered half of my bread and didn't cut my sandwich in half properly. I had to do it myself went I go into work. Seems like he has never made a sandwich before. While the service was friendly, the overall quality of the food was simply not worth the price. Been going rustic on and off for years never had a bad lunch highly recommend if about and around livery street area won't be disappointed Food was nice but the lady used her hand to pick the Tuna out of my Jacket potato when she put it on by mistake. A bit too Rustic for my liking. Good food though! - Adding to my previous review because of the dissapointing service.

I went in to get a Jacket Potato. The lady at the counter made another customer a Sausage sandwhich, without gloves and began using the same hands on the vegetarian options I was picking. The Cross Contamination in this place is ridiculous. Im not asking for your hands to be washed everytime but wear gloves at least. I shouldnt have to go into a shop, pay for a service and explain how my food should be made. It's dissapointing because its not the worst place to visit but every visit makes it more unbearable.

The Woman needs to learn some customer service skills as well. Not a smile in sight. You would think if someone is bringing money into your business you would at least force a smile. But not in this case sunshine! Lovely little cafe creating good honest breakfast sandwiches and baguettes plus toasties. A good choice of lunch time bespoked sandwiches and plus a hot meal special most days. Not forgetting a good warm beverage to be had. There are also salad box choices for those watching the calories.

The cafe is situated on a back road and the outside does look a little decrepit but  don’t let that fool you. Inside is a comfortably decorated and quaint little cafe.

I picked up an iced coffee, panini and cookie. The coffee was a generous size and tasted refreshing. The panini was halal.

A great find and I look forward to coming again. Friday 28 March 2025.
I was with my partner and saw the A board which promoted the £3.50 meal deal. The time was about 13.00pm.
We just about found the place on Cannon Street. It looked derelict from the outside.
We managed to go upstairs. 0 marks for accessibility. Anyone with mobility issues, in a wheelchair or with pushchairs won't be able to access the space, which is up narrow stairs into a large seated area.
The decor might try to give off New York style loft vibes. But it looked dated and dimly lit, cold and dirty like a run down warehouse.
The venue was empty. One person was behind the counter.
I enquired about the meal deal, to be told they were ""sold out"". I thought it's lunchtime, we're diabetic and we needed a quick bite. But if this is sold out, for a practically new eaterie, they need to do better. It's not like the venue was busy or full. There was no-one there and the offer of a meal deal ""sold out"" speaks volumes.

This is not a good start to a new business venture and I can't see it lasting more than 12 months. I've been twice now, both times the sign in the door says I'm within their opening times, both times the door has been locked.  I left a one-star review to suggest it's closed but the owner has replied to say they are closed for maintenance. I'm changing this to 3-stars as putting a notice on the door/updating google to reflect they are closed (as they obviously check their google page) would be helpful and save wasted journies.

UPDATE JUNE 25 - visited again in opening times, shut again. Opening times have vanished from the door. Putting back to 1 star, unclear if it's shut or not I got a coffee and hot chocolate and they were both great! Perfect atmosphere to sit and study, with nice friendly staff. I was outside at 8:45 on Sunday.

We ordered Kung pow chicken and you could really taste the vinegar. It wasn’t too overpowering though. It was a good balance of flavours. We also had the basa fish dish full of Szechwan flavours. The fish was perfectly cooked, really meaty and moist. The dish wasn’t too spicy even though there were lots of chillis in the sauce but I experienced a delightful numbing sensation on my lips which I was informed by my fellow diner was from the peppercorns. These two dishes were all we ordered between us (approx £8 each) but each came with a side of stir fried vegetables, fluffy white rice and a tomato and chicken soup. It was a feast! We were told if we ran out of these sides we could ask for more. I was tempted to, but I was too full! I really recommend this café and I will certainly like to return to try the other dishes. You can currently eat in at a small number of tables but the café is mainly for takeaway. The decor inside is simple and no frills, (your food is served in takeaway containers even if you eat in) but you’re not going there for the surroundings or crockery, you’re there for the amazing food and hospitality. I was so surprised about the quality of the food, £12 for a 3 meat dishes meal and plus unlimited soup, rice and stir fried veg, I have to give 5 stars and I will definitely go back. Good quality Asian food.
Highly recommended and the owner is a hardworking gentleman. Nice variety of food. My order came swiftly. It was nice. They also do meals which comes with a soup which is a nice touch.

Lovely relaxed atmosphere and music. Attentive staff and a great recommendation of the King Prawns in Tom Yum sauce.

The prawns were perfectly cooked and sauce was very tasty.

Recommended as a place for Thai. We recently dined at Siamais restaurant and had a truly wonderful experience. The food was absolutely delicious, beautifully presented, and full of flavour. The atmosphere was vibrant and stylish, creating the perfect setting for a relaxed and enjoyable evening.

A special mention goes to our waiter, Pedro, who made our visit even more memorable. He was incredibly friendly, attentive, and helpful when it came to recommending dishes and drinks. His warm personality and excellent service added so much to our overall experience.

We were thoroughly impressed and will definitely be coming back again and again. Highly recommended! I received prompt and professional service from Pedro and was seated immediately. The service and atmosphere were excellent. We ordered red duck curry, pad Thai, sweet and sour chicken, and green beef curry.  All dishes exceeded expectations.

The wine I drank was exceptional for its price.
Well worth the money and greatly recommend this place . As soon as you enter they welcome you with a warm smile and make sure you're looked after. The food was amazing. It was so flavourful and tasty and just the perfect amount of spice. As a south asian myself it's hard to find a good restaurant that truly serves authentically delicious dishes, so this really hit home. Can't wait to visit again! Customer service is just exceptional. Hard to find these days🫶🏽 I visited the Taj Mahal restaurant over the last three nights and had a wonderful experience each time. Mr. Galib was especially polite, friendly, and helpful, which made the visits even more enjoyable.

The menu offers a good range of options without being overwhelming, allowing for a focus on quality ingredients. Both the starters and mains were excellent.

First time I've eaten here and didn't know what to expect.

The coronation chicken salad was good. I really enjoyed the coronation sauce. My friend had the pulled pork wrap and he said it was tasty and liked the mustard on it.

The strawberry milkshake was delicious. A good quality milkshake.

This place appears to be a busy deli shop for the local businesses. The prices are reasonable and the service is fast. Good selection of food to choose from. You can either do takeaway or they have limited seating inside and more seating outside on a quiet street. I was disappointed with Village Kitchen. A small operation and the service was unusual. They don’t make the sandwiches in front of you like most sandwich places i’ve visited, so you can’t tell them how much of something to add. The pricing structure is inconsistent and they charge extra for salads. The interior is very small and only seats 4 people but there is outdoor seating. But usually people opt for take away here.

Small sandwiches and barely any filling. Very disappointing. I was still hungry after eating a sandwich. Taste was okay but nothing revolutionary.

Decent for a quick bite to eat if you are unable to make your own sandwich. But overpriced for the quality you get. I went in a few months ago had a lovely sandwich. Yesterday and today I had the BBQ pulled pork with apple sauce and red onion. They were absolutely perfect. The even remembered my name. That personal touch meant so much. Wil definitely go out of my way to go back soon. Cute sandwich bar you could almost miss but glad we didn’t. Just stopped by for a takeaway coffee and samosa, sitting outside in the spring sunshine was a delight. The menu looked good and fab looking sandwiches. Nice area of Birmingham and I’ll return .

The food was fresh and delicious — I tried a variety of dishes and enjoyed every round.
The system is really unique: you pay around £33+ per person and get 4 rounds to order from the menu. In each round, you select your dishes, and they prepare everything fresh and bring it straight to your table. It’s not a buffet — it’s made to order, and the quality shows. You eat at your own pace, and when you’re ready, you move on to the next round.
The staff were amazing — friendly, attentive, and quick. The atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant, making the whole experience even better Delicious freshly cooked Japanese food. You order 3 main dishes each round and have all you can eat for the 2 hours slot for around £33. You can order as many sides as you like. Drinks not included but Sake was nice at £5.50 for a small bottle.

Lovely staff and great service!! One of the best Japanese restaurants in Birmingham! The food here is absolutely delicious — we come regularly and it never disappoints. The atmosphere is always welcoming and the staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating. A special mention to Yan, who always looks after us and makes us feel like special guests every time we visit. Highly recommended! This is THE place to go in Birmingham and the West Midlands to try Sushi. £30 cash each for unlimited rounds of Sushi for a little over 2 hours. Everything on the menu is fair game, prepared fresh and smells amazing.

Additionally, bringing your own food or drinks into the lounge or bar areas is not permitted—even though the food provided by the club is consistently poor. Members should have the freedom to eat or drink what they prefer and to use communal areas as they see fit, especially given the premium price point.
I’ll be switching to David Lloyd as soon as my membership expires. I have been a member of Edgbaston Priory Club for almost two months, and I regret joining every single day. The hygiene standards in the changing rooms and showers are shockingly poor. The products provided for showers are of the lowest possible quality, with an unpleasant smell that makes the experience even worse.
During one visit, I ordered a burger in the restaurant, and it was absolutely disgusting. I honestly couldn’t tell if it had been dropped on the floor or just prepared with zero care, either way, it was inedible. I emailed the manager about this issue, but nothing has changed since.

For the price this club charges, the facilities, food quality, and overall standards are unacceptable Very professional tennis courts, comfortable seats for the audience.  Toilets, food and drink area, large screens, points and formation... Easy access, parking spaces, cheap tickets.  I recommend this place to watch tennis matches with family and friends. Amazing experience first time watching tennis live. If you love tennis you should do it. We got to watch one of the greats venus, Williams. There are different places to buy food and drink bit you could take your own. Staff were really good and helpful. Had a fantastic day at the LTA Tennis. The weather helped as it was hot. We had seats right at the front, which was great. There's not much there if you don't like tennis.  I paid £10.00 to  park, which was worth it .

What an angel ! This is the worse Argos in Birmingham. Very bad customer service from ASSAD. He is very rude and he thinks he is too good for the job. He is very condescending in the way he talks to you and asks you irrelevant questions. His colleagues are just as bad as him and even the so called manager was very rude and did not want to help. Will not be sending my packages to this Argos again. 👎👎 Poor customer service. Lady at customer service was at the phone. She make me wait for couple of minutes while on the phone. I have asked about the item she said they don't have in stock. Requested her if she can check on which argos the stock is available. She said check own online. Then I requested to check my argos card balance, she said you can check it online, She was so rude, look like I disturbed her as she was on phone and she don't want to serve any customer. Great customer service. Bought a PlayStation pulse elite headset that practically fell apart after a few uses and although it was nearly 2 months since purchasing, understood my complaint and issued me a refund.

I get ideas for projects when I see what is available to buy although I don't buy it from here.
Thanks and Good Luck! Went to WH smith this morning. I went to the cashier,  I said good morning and the old man at the counter never replied. ""How Rude"" I'm  a tourist from Canada.

Really tasty sandwich, generous fillings and wonderful service from Aman! 😀 So pleasant, cheery - service with a smile. I will be back! Located in Jewellery Quarter, reasonably the prices are little bit higher than other Subways nearby. A small one, not many seats to dine in. The food quality is fine.

I hardly give 1 star, but this is unacceptable for me. The Subcard machine is irregularly broken here, with different issues every time. Even when it is working, the staff will always refuse to redeem any items with my points.

As a regular Subway customer, I really despise their behaviour and attitude. They should get this issue fixed as soon as possible if they care about it, otherwise you know what they are actually thinking and all I can do is staying away. I encountered a series of issues that left me disappointed. Firstly, the store closed nearly an hour before the posted closing time, inconveniencing me and others who expected to enjoy a meal within the regular business hours.This is not the first time for early closure. It has happened multiple times where instead of 8pm they have closed it at 7pm.

Furthermore, when I did manage to place an order, the quality of service declined noticeably. The staff seemed in a rush, resulting in poorly cut bread that affected the overall enjoyment of my sandwich with considerable less salad on my sub.I told the girl that this bread is not cut properly and it is broken from everywhere. She clearly ignored my concern. It appeared that the employee was eager to conclude their shift quickly, sacrificing the quality of the food and customer experience I had an extremely horrible experience at this subway even thought i am a loyal fan of the company. The female Indian cashier with a black bun behind the counter has made previously rude comments to my 2 friends who frequent the business regularly, we have brushed it off thinking it was an off day for her. We all work hospitality ourselves so this is nothing new.

However, we came in again the other day and she was serving us with the exact same rude and demeaning attitude, she called my friend ugly to her face and criticized my other friends subway order!!! While she was making it!!! In hindsight i was too nice, i genuinely have no idea what compels a worker to do something of this magnitude, whether she is targeting us specifically, or if she acts this way to other customers too, and i am writing this review to alert the store management. They don’t accept points here.

Absolutely awful, placed an order on uber and they only sent half of my order out!

This is clearly untrue as the bag they had sent it in was too small for it and it was completely stapled shut so there was no way the uber driver could’ve taken it!!

A sombre experience. We got there late in the afternoon and they'd just closed the queue. Guy in the desk asked us to wait in the spectacular round room and he'd let us sign when the current queue was gone.

I was extremely grateful for this.  I struggle with walking and I was exhausted. We signed the book and had a look at the exhibition before using the lift to get out.

So happy to have been able to visit this exhibition and the spectacular well maintained building.

Staff were amazing, very friendly and helpful. This is a really enjoyable museum. It’s worth noting that it’s free at the point of entry which for many families I’m sure is a huge bonus when entertaining children. And there is so much within this museum to entertain young and old with a new exhibits on the top floor focused on Birmingham and it’s history.The Ozzy Osbourne display will attract many people I’m sure. It wasn’t for me but it didn’t distract in anyway the enjoyment of the museum well done to all.  It’s located in the heart of the town hall square with good access to all the shopping areas. Great to call in on a rainy day or a hot baking day. A very good shop which is not something I would ever say but it’s worth visiting and so is the cafe set in the great hall. It’s huge with a great selection. The museum is still only partially open, but there's enough to make a visit very worthwhile.  There are some excellent works of art,  along with exhibits showcasing Birmingham's industrial past.
The building itself is well worth close examination.
There is a shop here,  and also the Edwardian Tea Rooms.
The coffee was mediocre,  while the muffin I bought had all the characteristics of having been made at the same time as the tea rooms.
Prices are high in the tea rooms (£7.35 for substandard coffee and cake), while items for sale in the museum shop are also priced to appeal to those with higher levels of disposable income. (It's not a given that everyone who enjoys art and history also enjoys over-paying for everything...)
Aiming high with prices is fine if quality and value match the price point. I don't think it does here - call me picky, but discerning also fits...
The museum and gallery are 5-star, and entry is free,  but whoever sets the prices for what's sold here needs to better understand the concept of value to the customer. Get that right, and the required profits will naturally follow... I visited Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery today and had a really great time. The building itself is beautiful and full of character, with impressive architecture that makes you feel like you’ve stepped into another time.

The Pre-Raphaelite collection was definitely the highlight for me. The artwork is stunning and well presented, with just enough info to give you context without being overwhelming. There’s also a great variety of pieces throughout the museum, from historic artifacts to more modern and local art. It’s a nice mix that keeps things interesting.

All the main areas were open during my visit, which was a nice surprise since I’d heard some parts had been closed previously. Everything was well laid out and easy to navigate.

The restaurant on site was a big plus. I stopped in for lunch and was really impressed with tasty food, decent prices, and a relaxed atmosphere. It’s a good spot to take a break and recharge.

Staff were friendly and helpful, and the museum is free to enter, which is incredible for the quality of the experience. Whether you're into art, history, or just exploring interesting places, this is well worth a visit. I’ll definitely be back again. Birmingham is lucky to have a space like this. Easy to spend a long time here, even with parts of the museum being closed. Very well done exhibitions! I really liked the reflections on the provenance of some of the objects. It’s great to see museum staff taking their responsibilities seriously. Another great exhibition was by Christopher Samuel on the experiences of people with disabilities.

Thankyou for putting up with us 💓 Hands down, in my humble opinion, the best bar in Birmingham.
Great staff , excellent service … cool themed decorations … refreshing beers and cocktails.
I’ve visited Merlin’s during “Back To The Beginning” event, and the atmosphere was fire , from Black Sabbath bingo to the music, to the people and staff .. I mean it was just perfection.
when I come back to Birmingham, I’m sure gonna be visiting here again.
I highly recommend checking it out 🤘🦇 Love it here been a few times staff are always welcoming and all the horror decorations around the place are brilliant, my 6yr old loves it. Always have events at different times of the month and the music is always on point highly recommend if ur into rock and metal music It's a great horror themed pub playing metal music in the background while your having a beer in a city and place where it should be played. There were more established businesses near to here have unfortunately closed in the last few years with a similar theme. So, if it's your thing, it's fantastic, so support it and give it sustainability. There are friendly staff, it's a great place and really good beer. I didn't eat here so I can't comment about the food but I'd very happily visit again. Excellent 👍 Merlin's Cafe Bar Review

I recently visited Merlin's Cafe Bar and, unfortunately, it was a bit of a mixed experience. Despite the place being nearly empty, the food took a surprisingly long time to arrive, which was disappointing. When it finally did, it was no better than average—nothing particularly memorable.

On a more positive note, the service was friendly and attentive, which was a real saving grace. The staff do their best, but it’s a shame they aren’t backed up by the quality or efficiency of the food.

The decor is definitely a highlight. It’s well done and provides plenty to look at while you wait—something that came in handy given the delays.

Overall, Merlin’s has some potential, but the food needs to step up to match the good service and appealing atmosphere.",1.0,0.0,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['themed', 'music', 'cafe bar', 'decorations', 'metal', 'theme', 'bar', 'visited', 'staff', 'cocktails']","[""themed"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""bar"", ""visited"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""cocktails"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Cafe"", ""staff"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""music"", ""cafe bar"", ""decorations"", ""theme"", ""metal"", ""Experience""]"

I’m a returning customer and have been a few times now, and it never disappoints. Each visit I try a new burger option, and every single one has been tasty.

A huge selling point for me, as a pescatarian, is that I can choose any burger on the menu and simply swap the beef for a vegan patty, no awkward menu limitations here! The loaded fries are next-level; the flavours absolutely explode in your mouth. I’d love the portion size to be slightly bigger, but they’re so generous with the sauce and toppings that you can’t really complain.

The drinks are delicious, refreshing, and reasonably priced, always a bonus.

I’d highly recommend Han Bao to anyone who loves a burger or fries that are packed with flavour and seasoning. Whether you’re a meat eater, vegan, or somewhere in between, you’ll find something to love here. Solid 10/10. Cannot fault one bit! I booked for a rather large party and was asked to prebook our food. The efficiency of which everything came out was commendable and the server we had was beyond lovely. The food was so so good, we keep coming back and have brought/converted friends and family. Plently of free parking outside after 6pm but carparks a short walk away only £4 all day or less.
Close to other activities  like go carting and ghetto golf.
Easy to reserve online.
Greeted by a lovely  enthusiastic  gentleman  who made me feel excited to be there. Very friendly.
The waitress was also polite, friendly and helpful.
( I'm  not much of a burger person but we went because  my husband loved going with his friends)  Handao MADE me a burger person! From the first bite, it was the best burger I had ever tryed.
We ordered 3 burgers because they all looked great!  3 burgers, 2 sides and 2 alcoholic drinks came to £60.  The meal and service and atmosphere  IS WORTH IT!  Obviously  couldn't  finish it all and the staff where happy to let us take away the rest.
Reccomending the

Piggy Smalls and Dak Kang Nice exterior and entrance to bar and waiting area which is nicely/quirkly decorated.
Table wasn't ready,  ordered a drink and by that time is was ready.
Sat in a nice corner table (as 4 of us),  server was really friendly, helpful and had out food out in no time.
We all enjoyed our burgers, wings and waffle fries,  beer on tap was refreshing and tasteful.
Only minus point - i found the small wooden stools at our table to be a little uncomfortable ( as 4 of us, 2 sat on the cushioned seats, 2 on stools).
Overall, I will definitely return - really enjoyed every aspect in service, food and ambience. Five stars for HANBAO! We absolutely loved our food—burgers were juicy and full of flavour, the dirty fries were next level, and the cocktail selection was spot on. The staff were super friendly and gave us some great recommendations. The atmosphere was amazing—very cool vibe throughout.

It is a big space plenty of space on a main road, easy to find.

Very comfortable seats and big tables.

I wish I would have found this place earlier. I’ll be totally honest, I gave 5 stars because the price reflected what I got. It was not a good quality breakfast by a mile, but if you don’t mind cheaper produced foods then it is fine for the price. Service very good I enjoyed a very good tasting X Large English breakfast at Dream cafe and restaurant. Navine was a very friendly hostess. Very enjoyable experience.

The pastries are one-of-a-kind — rich in flavor, beautifully made, and absolutely delicious. The coffee is just as impressive — perfectly balanced and spot-on every time. It’s the kind of place that makes you want to slow down and savor the moment. Highly recommend! Not too crowded like Gail’s in London. Beautiful interior, lots of plants and friendly staff. I had an oat milk hot chocolate made with dark chocolate. Delicious! So much so I returned just for the hot chocolate , this time sitting upstairs in the light airy space! Great GAIL’s experience. I was a little worried about visiting this branch of GAIL’s after reading some bad reviews but we had a really good experience, consistent with others we’ve visited in Manchester, Bristol and London. Lots of choice from the bakery/fridges/counter, food all fresh and delicious, amazing coffee and really helpful and polite staff. Didn’t disappoint- we’ll definitely be back! I had high expectations for Gail Coffee, but unfortunately, my experience didn’t live up to them. The long queue was poorly organized, likely due to the setup. Some people seemed to hold up the line, standing there trying to decide what to order, which only added to the delay. Once they had their drinks, they continued to linger, making it harder for others to decide quickly and move through the line faster. It felt like they tried to squeeze as much as possible into a small space, but this only made the situation worse. Also, based on the price, the coffee didn’t stand out in taste—it wasn’t anything special. Went in to try the advertised strawberry iced tea but they’d sold out. Had to ask if they had any others!! Surely it’s a selling technique or basic customer service skills to offer an alternative! They told me about a raspberry iced tea. Neglected to mention it was sparkling and literally from a can. Total waste of £4 honestly really disappointed. Not a lot of space for tables and staff aren’t going out of their way to talk to you.

Loved it! Will be back to try different boozie slush flavours and some candies. I absolutely love this shop. It's my number 1 stop for all my American snacks. The pricing is more than fair, the staff aren't just friendly, they're also really helpful. Sometimes I get lost in their wall of choices.  Gets better and better each time I come down here.

Let's be honest, we all want to try that American Corn dog... Come see for yourself the great range they have 🥰 Shop looks way bigger online, they didn't have baskets so wasnt able to get as much as I wanted, only as much as I could hold in my hands. there was also no prices on any thing, if there was prices I would have got way more stuff so I knew what I was spending, I was talking to the people who work there and they commented on 1 product I got ( PB&J popcorn) that they wanted to try, but didn't want to pay the £7 for a bag In case they don't like it, but they expect us as customers to do it though 😂 the alcohol section and tobacco section was way bigger then the candy section. And TBF there wasn't much choice in American candy
My brother paid almost £30 for just 4 drinks. Expensive beers, don't accept the excuse that it's because they're craft beers. Should be a load cheaper.  Also check out the sell by dates. Often out of date. They say they will withdraw them from sale but they don't.  Trading Standards need to get involved Great vibe!!Great choice/selection of products, shelves are always stocked up…
I work shifts patterns, so the fact they are open 24 hours is really convenient for me and most importantly I’m always greeted with a smile no matter what time of day it is..
For me good customer service, is the back bone to any business and Candy and Liquor will not let you down, the staff are welcoming and respectful, which is very hard to find in a busy city centre environment/establishment.
I will continue to shop here and encourage others to do so..

Damn! That was soooo good, I had to refrain from moaning after the first bite in case people got the wrong idea. Absolutely smashes any place to eat at for Detroit pizza! The buffalo chicken was amazing; such a great option and I favoured it more than my “go to” which is usually of the “pepperoni & hot honey” variety. Pizzas are incredibly filling, soft thick base and a crunchy exterior. The service is top class with attentive and polite people! Located under a railway bridge this is a hidden gem within a few minutes walk from new street station.
It is worth mentioning that the pizza is served on Wednesdays from 5pm and on Saturdays from 12pm only.

Edit- The Nduja special is amazing!! Went there on a Wednesday after work to enjoy their food night. The place is located few minutes from central station but yet slightly hidden so it’s not too busy or loud. The food was good. We took 2 slices and it was too much. They are really rich and filling! If anything, I would rather recommend getting the garlic bread.
The drink menu is full! I loved that the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I was able to taste a bit of the tap drink I was going for to ensure that I would like it. If you tell them what you like, they can recommend you suggestions and I loved that.
Overall, it’s the perfect place to unwind after work, try out new drinks and have a good chat in a chill place. Fantastic craft beer and a really nice deep dish pizza. Very convenient for moor street station and highly recommended. Great chill atmosphere and very friendly staff. High quality food, served quickly. I enjoyed the fluffy base and crispy crust of the Corner Shop pizza, unfortunately the classic was just too oily and messy for my taste. Along the right lines but missed the mark for me.

Everything was fresh and perfectly portioned. Would 100% recommend. Our server Parthmesh was lovely - really accommodating and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you - will will be back! **Review of Demesecan Coffee House**

I recently visited **Demesecan Coffee House** and had a mixed experience. The staff were **friendly and welcoming**, which created a nice atmosphere. I ordered **saffron tea and toast**—the tea arrived quickly and was delicious, but the toast took **much longer** to come out.

When it finally arrived, it was just **plain toasted bread** with **separate butter cubes on the side**. The butter wasn’t even melted on the toast, which made it feel a bit **lazy and underwhelming**. For a place that seems cozy and well-run, I expected better—maybe **properly buttered and warmed toast** instead of having to do it myself.

**Pros:**
✔ Friendly staff
✔ Quick tea service
✔ Nice ambiance

**Cons:**
❌ Long wait for toast
❌ Unmelted butter served separately (felt cheap)
❌ Toast could have been prepared better

**Verdict:** A decent spot for drinks, but the food execution needs improvement. **3/5** for now—would return for the tea but maybe skip the toast.

Would love to see better attention to small details like this in the future! Great environment and lovely staff! Samaneh was very friendly & accommodating and helped us pick out the best desserts available that day. We also ordered some lunch menus which did not disappoint. I've always had good experiences coming to this branch and will keep recommending it to family and friends! I ended up visiting this coffee house on the weekend. I was the first customer at 10am and within 20 minutes the place was packed out. It’s probably one of the best coffee places in Birmingham. The servers were friendly and helpful. The chicken shawarma wrap was fresh & delicious. The chicken hummus was also really flavoursome. Pot of tea was made using fresh leaves.

On side note, everything was clean & hygienic. Also toilet facilities are on site too which is maintained. It wasn’t my first time , but it is the first time I’m leaving a review. I’ve eaten here before and I’m generally always very satisfied with the food.
The only small point I’d mention is that I would’ve liked the waitress to be a bit more attentive or quick.

One of the staff was very well mannered and polite, another was the exact opposite. Coffee was better than average. I visit various Nero's a lot because I like them so much better than the other multinational company owned coffee shops. I find them a lot more informal places and more relaxed. On my last visit to this particular Nero's, I had the misfortune to accidentally drop all my stuff off the counter. Glass went everywhere I did manage to salvage a bit of my coffee but the staff couldn't have been more helpful. I take my hat off to them because the all work their socks off bless them. To top it all the member of staff who was about to go home from her shift was sooooo helpful I said I was sorry but she said no problem. She sorted it out and went home bless her ❤️. I've got nothing but praise for the staff at every Nero's, hence that's why I go. I always speak as I find. Many thanks for the stay can't wait until the next time. I like this Nero branch at Bullring Link to Grand Central is more quiet which is what I like about its ambience. You can have a great chat with your favourite cuppa. The place is spacious but cozy. Staff are nice and friendly. Love the coffee! My fave is Pistachio latte whether hot or cold but I opted for cappuccino this time around as I needed   a pick me upper. It’s a branch I keep coming back to. Very nice Caffè Nero that we visited 3 times over 2 days in central Birmingham.

Lovely hot chocolate and coffee.

Plenty of nice relaxed seating, quiet relaxed atmosphere. All staff friendly and efficient. Place and tables all clean and cleaner than most branches. Even though this branch is in a mall it doesn’t feel like you’re in a corridor of a mall.

Great branch. Used to love this Nero – great location and one guy used to make my drink just right. Then he got moved for “affecting stock levels,” which seemed over the top.

There’s a woman (maybe the manager?) who’s often in a bad mood. Once said “Back again?” like I had no other choice. Saw her tell another customer they couldn’t get more milk without paying extra because it messed with her stock count.

Thanks Michelle and team for looking after us. The fish was large and super tasty. I also had battered chips with my fish. The Irish curry sauce was so tasty. Would I return again? A big fat yes!! Went in on a Fri lunchtime with quite a big order for the office hadn't been in for a while was very impressed.  Was greeted by very friendly staff who were helpful and sorted out my order quickly. I was chatting to them as they did the order and all the order was marked up as the did it so no confusion.  They also gave a couple of samples for us to try and all at the office was very impressed.. but the most important thing was the food was delicious and very good value for money. I have been a few times before and getting tired of being served up dry kebab meat!!

My last visit before today I asked for the meat cut from the kebab and not to be taken from the pots where it is left to dry! and they ignored my request.

So today I specifically asked for the meat to be cut and was told I would have to wait 15 minutes.  I advised I was more than happy to wait and the place was empty so it's no real chore.

Then the man who I assume was the boss was saying he just cut it before I arrived (convenient) so eventually I relented and accepted it from the pots.  HEY PRESTO!! dry meat that has clearly been sat there for a while just because there appears to be an insistence of ignoring what the customer wants.

I've been in countles chip shops and most will take ten minutes or more to get it hot enough to cut from the skewer.

It hasn't take Island house long to end up being just as crap as Sir Harry's chippy before it.  Always cutting corners charging premium prices for basic chip shop food.

I will not be setting foot in this establishment again.  Another new broom sweeps clean all because of a man who just pretends he's done something when this is clearly not true. Lovely fresh food made here.
Been coming here for so many years. It used to be called Sir Harry's before.

Ordered the lunch time box meal box. Amazing fresh chips. Cod fresh was fresh and piping hot.

Customer service was very good and the young lady was very polite.

Very reasonably priced and decent sized portions.  It's also halal which is brilliant. The food and service was better when they had that other girl that always smiled when she was doing the salt and vinegar.

I'm sure if you're here in a massive group it would be alright, not great but not bad. We came as a small group to watch some sport and didn't last more than 1 pint. This place is fine, it serves beer, shows sport and has games but it's also over priced and a bit tacky. In all honesty, that's probably how it needs to be for this business model. Had an unforgettable time at Bierkeller for Oktoberfest! The atmosphere was electric, with traditional Bavarian music and the staff dressed in festive attire, making the experience feel authentic and fun. One of the standout moments was receiving cocktails in pint sizes—definitely a pleasant surprise and a great value!

The food was equally amazing. Along with classic Bavarian dishes, we were given a giant, soft pretzel that was the perfect pairing with our drinks. Everything came together to create an incredible night. If you're looking for a lively Oktoberfest experience, Bierkeller is the place to be! I recently visited Bierkeller Birmingham for their Bavarian night with a group of friends on a stag do, and unfortunately, it was a bit of a letdown compared to what we remembered from our university days. In the past, the Bavarian night had a full band performing, creating a lively and fun atmosphere. However, this time, there was just one man (who did his best to be a good host) and one woman, who didn't really add much. As mentioned, the host really was trying and he was fairly funny, but overall it was just a bit “meh”.

At £20 per person, we were expecting a more engaging experience, but it felt lacking in comparison to previous visits. The energy just wasn't there, and despite the host's efforts, it didn't live up to the excitement we were hoping for. For anyone planning a stag or hen do, I'd recommend exploring other options in the area—this time around, Bierkeller Birmingham didn't quite hit the mark Went along to watch the superbowl really happy we booked here staff were amazing and the food and drinks were amazing Went for the r n b brunch.

Place was packed and people going for it from early doors.

This is a party place and people going for it. Not for anyone seeking a quiet time for sure.

Security was tight but polite.

Drinks were reasonably priced and there are people were having shots from trays that were bring brought around.

I think people will enjoy this if they are seeking some fun.

Dj had an mc also and this worked well with the crowd playing popular r n b soul house and garage mostly.

She was incredibly welcoming and greeted me with a big, genuine smile that instantly brightened my day. Her friendly attitude and warm service made a simple drink feel like a special moment. It’s always refreshing to be served by someone who clearly enjoys their work and knows how to make customers feel valued. Thank you, Megha! I am using the good-to-go app but I am basing my opinion on if one were to pay the full price for these products. This is the first time I have used upper crust. I had a very dry half of a baguette with half of a small sausage It was disgusting. I had a falafel with some peppers in a whole baguette which was of average taste. I had the worst example of a cheese baguette I have ever received in my lifetime as you can see from the photograph the thinnest slices of cheese I have ever seen with a couple of slices of very thin tasteless tomatoes. I strongly advise nobody to shop here. I think they should change their name to Lower Crust. This would be more appropriate. My friend and I visited Upper Crust, expecting a fair deal from their Too Good To Go offer, but what we got was anything but. We were handed just two meagre sandwiches, a far cry from what was advertised. When my friend politely pointed this out, the staff responded with open hostility, speaking to them with an attitude that was unnecessarily rude and dismissive. And then, as if one wasn’t enough, another member of staff jumped in, doubling down, backing up the rudeness like it was policy. The whole encounter left us shocked and frankly appalled… What a lovely atmosphere! Staff Megha and TT were really nice, friendly, and welcoming. The coffee tasted great, and the muffin was lovely. The only thing is, the prices are a little too high.I think it would be great to see more meal deals at affordable prices. Megha/Tina were really patient and kind with me even though I was clearly indecisive. Great and efficient service and I was able to catch my train.

This would be my only criticism and im sure it is only a temporary situation. On the whole, definitely worth a visit, ( although a little pricey). We arrived at browns for our annual staff party.

I always have a lovely time at Browns.
Only downside was the menus made of card  were a little dirty. They weren't sticky or gross but they were obviously dirty and could do with being replaced.

Fantastic ingredient led food, delicious clever classic wine pairing, served by lovely people in beautiful surroundings. This was a wonderful indulgent treat, gifted by a good friend. We had a 3 course lunch, where the plates were small, but there were so many little extra courses we certainly did not leave hungry.
For me the many tasters was wonderful as I can get bored of one large plate that loses its individual tastes.
The service was immaculate, I even had a footstool for my handbag! Wonderful place to celebrate our Ruby Anniversary!  All the staff made us feel so special, their friendliness and all the little extras.  They are a lovely group of young people with enthusiasm and a real warmth and passion for what they do.

Wow.

The room was tired and looked as if it gets zero maintenance. I asked for a double but had 2 single beds pushed together they were not secured so separated during the night causing a gap. I was concerned with the hygiene of the room as there were cobwebs above the mirror and ceiling. The light pull cord was filthy and there was no handle on the inside of the shower. Lighting in the room was awful they still use the old bulbs which emit yellow light the main ceiling lampshade had dead flies inside. I mentioned all this to reception who offered me another room I declined and requested its cleaned tomorrow. When I retuned next day after room was serviced it was exactly the same very poor housekeeping standards. Bar and restaurant is across the road in the main centre very pleasant but mega expensive i.e. bottle of pale ale £6.50. There are no bars or shops near so its a long walk or taxi every time you need to go out if you dont drive like me. The price was very good compared to city centre but by the time you add all the extras its not much of a difference, next time I will pay city centre prices and have a more comfortable stay. Really nice smart new hotel. Rooms were very nice clean and comfortable. Service throughout was friendly and efficient. Breakfast was very good. Especially the sausages. Plenty of car parking and perfect if working on campus or at a conference. I am on my second night here in Lucas House and have not been impressed with the level of accommodation. The room has a draft  from the window which with the low operation of the radiator makes sitting on the work desk cold. Then they decide not to inform me that the dining room is closed all weekend which was one of the reasons of booking the hotel and not a b & b. Seems if you are young and fit the rooms here would suit but some rooms are a long way from entrance and I find little way to get to them apart from walking up two separate staircases.
The staff are friendly and probably are the only reason this hotel can keep going.
Third day and heating has Improved although still not overly impressed with the room. Sorry to say but not a Hotel of choice and I will be looking for other accommodation for my next stay in Birmingham. Rooms were clean, basic. Breakfast was decent.

Food is very reasonably priced and is both delicious and presented well.

Staff are friendly and I would highly recommend! Popped in with family member to try out the meal and a drink offer. It was cold at the table we were sitting at, had to keep our scarfs on. Most of the tables including the one we sat at had people’s half drank drinks, tables wasn’t cleared or cleaned. I had to ask the bar woman and she cleared and cleaned our table promptly. I can’t fault the service. The food was tasty but not much to brag about. We had the bangers n mash(could have added more peas- the gravy was good 👍🏽) and gammon steak meal with egg(could have been presented better, the look like someone had cut of the egg white and left just the yolk) with two large glass of Diet Pepsi. The drinks selection was great, you get a good amount per glass.
The ladies toilets need urgent maintenance work. Toilet seats and door locks need looking into and again it was that cold you could see the steam coming from the toilet bowl after it was used😮 We had an absolutely fantastic time at O'Neill's in Broad Street, Birmingham! A huge shoutout to Shae and Chloe who went above and beyond to look after our party. From arranging delicious food and drinks to setting us up with darts, everything was seamless and so well-organized. Their friendly, professional, and upbeat service made our night truly memorable.

Thank you both for making it such a great experience — we’ll definitely be back soon! Good food and good service, little cold with the smoking area open out the back.
Plenty of option on the food menu which is quite tasty.
Match was on and there wasn’t much atmosphere. I went here to watch football and have a couple of drinks with my partner whilst our young son had a bite to eat.

Give the guy a raise. Customer service is a fundamental aspect of any product or service. As an iPhone user for the past 15 years, I recently encountered a significant issue with my iPhone 15, which refuses to turn on. Despite the phone being under warranty, the company has declined to exchange it due to a slight bend, as explained by an employee. It is important to note that both the front and back screen glass are intact and in pristine condition, indicating no physical damage to the phone. This situation is deeply frustrating and reflects a lack of professionalism and arrogance on the part of the staff. Consequently, I intend to lodge a formal complaint and leave a review on all relevant platforms to express my dissatisfaction with the company’s handling of this matter. If you intend to purchase an Apple product, it is advisable to consider purchasing separate insurance coverage. My son loved the VR headset demo.

The checkout process was efficient, during peak hours, the fitting rooms could get quite busy, leading to a short wait.

I was met with a really off putting demeanour. The lady looked offended and disgusted that i asked her a question. I was immediately taken back and rather offended. I asked to view the bracelet but the staff member just looked like she couldve killed me. She was really uninterested and actually scared me away. Shame because they lost a sale of over £100. I will instead purchase through the actual brand’s website and not on next. Security guard followed my daughters out of the store today after the alarms went off , followed them all the way out of the bullring and then shouted at them because they didn't hear him, made them go back to the store even though they showed him their bags immediately and then told them to get their hearing checked because they hadn't heard him. Upon getting back to the store he didn't even check their bags even though they told him they had not purchased anything and just shrugged and let them go.

Also the food came cold not fresh anymore and also very very dry, i been a customer since times and today is very disappointing. Lastly i ordered the garlic sauce and garlic n herb but they only gave me garlic n herb saucand some other sauces that i didnt ask. Making me dont wanna order from online platforms again, maybe its better to order in person…. :( I’m a picky person and I’m very happy with their food and service. Their food is definitely delicious and value for money! Keep it up guys you are being amazing! Absolutely terrible experience. I ordered a spicy shawarma meal, and they gave me a non-spicy version with cold fries. I politely asked for hot sauce and fresh fries. Instead, they just reheated the same soggy fries and gave them back. Shawarma was bland and tasteless. I asked for extra hot sauce to at least add some flavor, and they were rude and charged me £1.50 for it. Absolutely ridiculous. Never coming back. I’ve been craving a good shawarma for ages, but let’s be real — they usually don’t hit right. Either the spices are way too overpowering, or the flavour just isn’t there. So when my friend mentioned a new takeaway called Dr Shawarma that opened just 5 minutes from where I live, I wasn’t in a rush to try it. I thought, “Here we go again, nothing new.”

But tonight hunger hit hard, and as I was driving down Bristol Road, I spotted Dr Shawarma and thought, “You know what, let’s give it a go.” I told myself I’d get the chicken shawarma meal — and if it flopped, at least I’d still have the chips to fall back on.

There was a bit of a queue, but it moved quickly. The staff were really friendly, and I got my food quicker than expected. Now here’s the real moment… I opened the shawarma not expecting much, took a bite and OH MY — absolutely delicious. The flavour was spot on, tasted genuinely like something you’d get in the Middle East. It had that perfect balance of spices, not overpowering at all. And the chips? Fresh, crunchy, and actually worth mentioning!

I honestly loved it. I’d give it a solid 8/10, and trust me, that’s the rating I’d give even in the Middle East.

Well done, Dr Shawarma. You’ve impressed me, and I can’t wait to try the rest of your menu! What a great late night food venue! The service is always top notch and the shawarma is never dry, no matter the time! Asked for a pot of hummus which they added on at no extra charge. Love these guys !

We had a fantastic time at The Church Pub! Though there was a small mishap with our meal, the team handled it brilliantly and made sure everything was put right great customer service!

A huge shout-out to Hallie, who was an amazing barmaid friendly, attentive, and made us feel so welcome. Jordan was also fantastic, ensuring we had a great experience throughout.

We originally just popped in for food, but the atmosphere was so lovely that we ended up staying for four hours! Will definitely be returning soon. Highly recommend!

**5/5 – A brilliant pub with a fantastic team!** 🍻 So good to find an Everards Brewery pub in town with well kept, reasonably priced cask ale.  There looks to be some fantastic, left-field bar snacks available if you’re here primarily to drink.  Friendly, informative and efficient bar staff on hand surely have contributed to this pub being to the 2025 Good Beer Guide. Fantastic roast on the sun trap roof terrace. Cocktails 241 on Sundays and they're really good too. Great service as always and really reasonably priced for the quality. Lovely food and great service, served by Jordan and chef Noel! Popped in for a couple of pints, there was a nice selection of beers and a very impressive selection of soft drinks on draught. Barman was sound, friendly service. Can't comment on the food as I didn't eat here.

Was told of the happy hour with 2 for 1 on cocktails but as I was with my kid, I declined it this time! Sat on the rooftop terrace which was a lovely setting to have a drink in.

This was the first pub I ever had a drink in, back in 1997. It's definitely changed a lot for the better since then, a reflection of how the surrounding area has also become something different to back then.",1.0,0.0,"[""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['pub', 'pub fantastic', 'fantastic', 'church', 'terrace', 'reasonably priced', 'reasonably', 'drink', 'popped', 'cocktails']","[""Bar/Pub"", ""Experience"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""drink"", ""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""pub"", ""church"", ""reasonably priced"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""cocktails"", ""Portion Size"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""fantastic"", ""Drinks"", ""terrace"", ""popped"", ""reasonably"", ""Value"", ""pub fantastic""]"

My partner loved his sandwiches, he did get two because he didn't realise their size but he still enjoyed them both!

We also had a latte with a vanilla shot and strawberry milkshake, both lovely, the coffee especially.

Overall the atmosphere is very relaxing and cosy, it wasn't busy and the staff are really friendly and welcoming. Very accomodating to your tastes and clearly take pride in the cleanliness, presentation and customer service.

We would highly recommend coming here for breakfast, we can't wait to come back (: Update: service seems to depend on the staff member as our most recent experience was very mid, with no acknowledgement from the staff member upon opening and lack of any friendliness you’d expect from a coffee shop.

Of course, it depends on what you’re looking for, but we personally didn’t enjoy our visit.

The service felt very intense, almost like the staff were looking down on us. I get that they have a certain etiquette, but true professionalism means adapting to each customer’s mood and experience – not making them feel uncomfortable. The food itself wasn’t bad, but for a Michelin-rated place, it didn’t blow us away.

We went with a Groupon voucher gifted to us, and were surprised when the bill included a hefty service charge of the full price menu, instead of just charging on top of drinks. I understand that some fine-dining places automatically include service, and normally I’m happy to pay it – if the service matches. But what if it’s young students or guests who received it as a gift and weren’t expecting to be hit with an extra £40–£50? Definitely something worth considering.

What bothered me most was that while filming parts of the experience (which is common in fine dining these days), the waiter told me not to film him as he presented the food. I wasn’t filming him directly – just capturing the overall experience. If you’re working in a high-end, presentation-focused restaurant, you should expect that some guests will be recording. If that’s an issue, maybe a different work environment would suit better.

Overall, the food was decent but not unforgettable, and you can absolutely find better Michelin-level restaurants where the service is warm, respectful, and genuinely customer-focused. Sadly, this one didn’t live up to expectations. Excellent Michelin quality food right in the centre of Birmingham. Very well executed not stuffy friendly vibe. The restaurant was full. We had our two months old baby with us who was welcomed. A true gem in the dining world! A place I have had the privilege of experiencing multiple times and each time improving on perfection! Talking on my last visit I must say this is a epicentre in not only the midlands but also the UK that all food and wine lovers must attend. We enjoyed the Chefs Table along with Wine pairings and it truly was an amazing experience.
Every piece of food so thoughtfully made within eyesight and explained by the accompanying chef. Wonderfully enjoyed beyond words, needs to be eaten to believe.
Each course served with a perfectly matched wine from the truly knowledgeable Sommelier with a knowledge base far reaching every question asked!
The kitchen staff themselves being an amazing team working together in a fluid atmosphere with the real life day to day, and the amazing teamwork to create the most amazing food all under the eye of Chef Adam. A true great. Fantastic dining experience in the heart of Birmingham on the fly, PJ and his team were excellent hosts and very gracious for the experience. I would highly recommend anyone coming to Birmingham to sample the delightful menu and experience. Stand out dishes include the sweetbread with a beautiful lovage sauce and crunchy almond.

The 50 year old port is a must for anyone, one for the bucket list and the Spanish sommelier is a lovely guy who clearly has a passion for his role and it shines through.

A lot more to say however all positive and will be back again Very nice 7 course taster menu. Pigeon was fantastic!

However, today, I left this place extremely disappointed. Here’s why:
1.	Atmosphere and Ambiance:
As soon as we entered, there was an overwhelming stuffy smell; the kitchen odors hit you right in the face. Everything looked very messy, disorganized, and worn out.
2.	Cleanliness:
There were dirty used forks and napkins on the floor, and the staff were stepping over them as they walked by. The tables were sticky with grease and sauce stains from previous customers and had not been cleaned properly.
3.	Taste:
Both my meal and my spouse’s meal were served cold. The salads inside had no oil, no salt, and no dressing. The fries were also cold. We were both honestly shocked.
4.	Restrooms:
I was very surprised to see that the male and female restrooms were right next to each other without any separation. This is a basic expectation considering the general clientele of a halal restaurant. In fact, even many British restaurants ensure this comfort with separate entrances for men and women. I was very surprised and disappointed. Moreover, the restrooms were extremely dirty.
5.	Music:
There was very loud pub-style music with heavy bass playing. It was extremely overwhelming. Of course, music could be adjusted easily, but their choice of music shows how disconnected they are from the spirit of this business.

I truly did not want to write a negative review, but I felt I had to, with much regret and disappointment. I sincerely hope this feedback is taken seriously and improvements are made because German Döner is a brand — and this branch does not reflect the brand’s reputation at all. I am sorry to say this. Top place after a day of drinking! We had little box meals with so much food it was also hot and chips weren't soggy. Not quite happy really. I had meat kebab which was crystal cold.

Environment and is not clean and tidy. Staff jumping over forks on the floor. Toilets smelling bad.

Chips was warm but not well mixed with spice.

I need GDK to be good because its an halal franchise that we’ve been in most cities.

I’ve been recently in Edinburgh branch. It was really good from all perspective. You guys have a lot to learn from Edinburgh branch. Sorry but I’ll need GDK to be good. Grabbed the Doner in pitta 🥙 food was decent however doner to salad ratio wasn’t good unfortunately it was near to 70% salad. Donner itself was cooked throughout. I am really impressed with the quality and taste of food. It's up to standard. Kebab bread is fantastic and very similar to a traditional Turkish. Food is bit expensive. But it's worth it.
There is far too much waste which needs to be addressed. Every food item is at least two layers of packaging deep.

A very pleasant hour, thoroughly recommend. We had a wonderful Afternoon Tea at Café Concerto. The service was at a high standard, being well looked after by Giuseppe and the team who kept our tea topped up and their hospitality friendly and informative.

The food was flavoursome, the egg mayo sandwich a must-have! The spread was colourful and well presented, offering a wide variety of textures and fillings. The scones were soft, and the little patisseries were delightful. The tea selection is great, and you have unlimited refills.

Being inside Grand Central, it's easily accessible and has a relaxing atmosphere, natural light all around with comfortable seating. Would highly recommend for friends and couples alike! I stopped by Café Concerto while passing through New Street Station. The café itself was fine – decent coffee and a light bite, though I did find it a bit on the expensive side for what it was.

That said, the atmosphere was lively and the standout was definitely the moving bull statue nearby – such a cool surprise to see that in a train station! It added a really fun vibe to the visit.

Overall, not a bad place for a quick stop if you're in transit, but be prepared to pay a little extra for the convenience and surroundings.

Easy walking distance to Gas Station Basin, Jewelry Quarter, Bullring, etc. Crowded, high-energy area, but safe and quiet inside the hotel. Our room was larger than expected and very clean and comfortable.  Front desk staff were very helpful overall, though some seemed happier about it than others.  Continental breakfast was good and presented in a very pleasant area.  I would definitely stay here again. We had a wonderful stay at the Premier Inn at Birmingham New Street hotel. The location was very convenient to the train station, the service was efficient and friendly, and our dinner and breakfast were very well prepared. Our dinner at the Thyme restaurant was especially noteworthy. Alfie went out of his way to provide outstanding service and the food we terrific and a great deal. Very rarely write reviews of hotels but I have been genuinely very pleased with this one. The rooms were decent sized and clean (double plus 2 singles for kids). Room had aircon and was amazingly quiet for the centre of Birmingham. En suite was well fitted and had a good shower. Staff were polite and helpful. Overall would definitely stay here again. Rooms were very well ready for my use, everything was put in place just the way I would want it on arrival, clean and tidy. The Premier Plus rooms had everything I needed: kettle, mini-fridge, water bottles, showering equipment etc.
Very convenient location: shops, public transport links, and other conveniences within walking distance and was seemingly safe in terms of security.
Great value for money.
Although staff were very friendly, helpful and assisting when they were there, there were many occasions when there was absolutely nobody at the front desk, so waiting for someone to be able to assist you at all was often a matter of waiting 10 minutes (approx), so I would suggest having 2 people at the front desk for each shift always, so even if 1 is gone away, the other will still be there. I would also suggest having in-room telephones.
The only other slightly disappointing factor was if we are staying more than 1 night, housekeeping is not done in the room unless requested before 12pm, which I didn’t realise until after that, and I wished the cups and mugs were changed and stock on water bottles and chocolate were replenished.
Overall, I do recommend this hotel since it meets 80-90% of average expectations, just those few little factors need working on: staff presence, telephone and housekeeping. Amazing stay!

Ironically the place was empty.

**in reply to your response (you clearly can't read or have read what I put.

I ASKED FOR A CUSTOMER TOILET. THAT WAS THE REPLY I GOT.

I explained I wanted breakfast and a coffee.

From Reading Further reviews your establishment seems a very strange place Got a sausage and egg baguette with hash browns for nice price (~£6). I was so glad something was open early in morning. The staff were very nice and chatty. Definitely will come again if I take another coach from Birmingham station. Had a wrap and the curly chips.
The wrap seemed fine, a bit stingy on the portion but overall not bad.
The curly fries looked amazing on displays but were soggy, hard, cold and very unseasoned. The server seemed annoyed I interrupted her chat with the nearby colleague and gave me a very rude service with not even a thank you or any type of kindness. I was exited to visit this please cause it’s very close from where I work and seemed always spotless and tidy. Unfortunately not very impressed. Overall disappointing… Excellent service great variety of healthy good food and awesome taste.

Makes a smart option to grab a bite when traveling between one coach and another.

Special thanks to our waitress ABBIE, she was super Friendly and Kind made us feel so welcome. Can’t wait to come back! Good authentic food, haven’t tried Korean food before. Glad this was the place that introduced me to it. Food is neatly laid out plenty of options, parking round the corner. 10/10 Came here for my sister’s birthday meal and I must say we were all very disappointed. We have noticed how the prices have gone up but portion sizes have gone down compared to when we last came 2 years ago. We paid £6 more this time for the same BBQ set and the amount of meat we were given was so little! Not worth it at all!! Incredibly disappointed and quite sad as we probably won’t return again as there are other restaurants better quality in food and better for price. Authentic Korean restaurant located at the heart of Birmingham. Love the chicken but i don’t think the ramen is good. The only issue is cash only… Delicious meal last night for an impromptu valentines dinner. We had the pork dumplings, seafood pancake and the table BBQ with pork belly and chicken. Doing a Korean table BBQ is always fun, the food was yummy but the standout from the meal were the crispy fried pork dumplings - we’ve both woken up today thinking about them 😅 the pancake was nice but not in the same league.

Only slight downside is that when you sit on the waiting tables at the side you can’t order a drink to have while you wait. However, luckily for us the wait was sort and service was fine.

It has limited seating and can get very busy, but is very convenient due to the long opening hours, and the staff are polite, helpful and friendly. In particular, a gentleman named Graham is brilliant - besides being friendly and efficient, he takes pains to remember your name and will often greet you by your name even after months of not having visited! It makes you feel very welcome. Thanks Graham and all the staff at this branch for your hard work! :-) Ordered 2 coffees at new st branch one Americano and one cappuccino after we paid £8.40 for two coffees we went to the collection point when they arrived my wife asked for chocolate powder sprinkled on top of her cappuccino which he did put on probably two shakes of the dispenser which was very little so she asked for more chocolate which he replied (with the chocolate shaker still in his hand)if you want more there’s a shaker over there thought it was a terrible reply and shop was not even busy ,I know Starbucks are struggling at moment maybe ought to look at customer service for improvement,I’ve spoken to a couple of people since and both said they haven’t used Starbucks for ages for similar reasons ,and I certainly won’t enter again I’ve been a loyal Starbucks customer for years, even when others decided to boycott the brand. Unfortunately, my recent experiences at the Birmingham New Street branch have left me quite disappointed due to the behavior of one of the employees, Afyia.

On multiple occasions, I’ve noticed that she rarely smiles or makes an effort to be welcoming. It often feels like customers are not valued when she’s around. Today was the tipping point. She came outside to collect chairs and tables, but instead of politely asking customers to move, she raised her voice and demanded, “Excuse me, we’re going to take the chairs inside now!” The tone was aggressive and commanding, which made me and others feel extremely uncomfortable.

What bothered me most was that there were plenty of other chairs available that could have been taken first, but she felt the need to target a few customers and rush them in such an impolite way. There was no reason for this kind of behavior. Basic courtesy goes a long way, and it’s disheartening to see this lack of professionalism, especially at a place like Starbucks where customer service should be a priority.

Great coffee is available everywhere these days, but customer service is what sets businesses apart. I hope Starbucks addresses this issue at the Birmingham New Street branch, as it’s not the experience I expect from a brand I’ve been loyal to for years. a small branch at the train station. There are counter seating areas inside and 5-6 table seating areas outside. The contiguous area is narrow. There are accessory stands. There are throwaway options. There are dessert options. There are coffee options. Usually the ball. Especially when the trains are empty, there is a queue. worst coffee ever… After telling this to them they prepared the coffee again (2 times). It was still horrible. They probably didn’t do the maintenance of their coffee machines. Or there was something wrong with the milk.

All with a smile . Thank you I needed this small act of kindness today . Very much appreciated L.V. Don't come here if you're a delivery driver. Absolutley useless location. The drinks are never ready and you have to stand there watching the staff constantly walk past the empty open take away bag because no one can be bothered to fulfill the order.

I wrote this review next to my bike after walking out and I can still see the empty bag just sitting there. The store has zero waiting customers and they're still ignoring the order. The store got staff were a little bit slow because they were only two staff members and it was quite busy
With takeaways
The stall is modern with a nice layout and good facilities, but it means a little bit more cleanliness, especially in the toilet area
And maybe some more soft seating, but overall it’s a nice place to chill with your friends and have coffee or for whatever you need to do and it’s link in the city Centre and it’s quiet because it’s off the main bit I stepped into Starbucks and immediately, the atmosphere felt like a warm embrace. The staff, wearing smiles as their uniform, made me feel like a cherished guest. From the very moment I walked in, I knew this was going to be a delightful experience.

Let me tell you about the Almond Croissant – a heavenly creation with a flaky crust that seemed to melt in my mouth. The almond cream filling was like a secret treasure, rich and velvety. This wasn't just a pastry; it was a work of art, carefully crafted to perfection.

But the surprises didn't stop there. The Banana Caramel Muffin was a symphony of flavors – sweet banana dancing with luscious caramel. And that topping? It wasn't just a topping; it was like a delicious crown, adding a crunch that was incredibly satisfying. Believe me, this treat is a journey you won't want to miss.

Then, there was the Blueberry Muffin – a burst of tangy and sweet berries in every bite. The sugar-crusted top was like a sweet secret waiting to be discovered with every mouthful. I couldn't help but close my eyes and savor the blissful moment.

The pain au Chocolat was a rendezvous with sophistication. With each bite, it was like I was transported to a charming French café. The fusion of flavors was like a dance of elegance and comfort in my mouth.

And let's not forget the Chocolate Twist – it was like a playful game of hide and seek with chocolate surprises. Every twist revealed a burst of cocoa goodness, and it was perfect for anyone with a love affair with chocolate.

So, here's my advice: plan a visit to Starbucks, indulge in these delightful creations, and then come back to thank me for introducing you to this world of taste and wonder. Your taste buds will thank you! A very clean and well lit Starbucks with one floor of seating, including chairs and sofas. Music was a bit loud so it was a little hard to concentrate on my book!

I don’t usually write reviews, but the service we received from Carl absolutely deserves recognition. From the moment we were seated, Carl made us feel welcomed and at ease. His warm, genuine attitude stood out immediately — attentive without being overbearing, and always one step ahead of our needs.

He knew the menu inside out and gave great recommendations that turned out to be spot-on. What really impressed us was his timing and attention to detail — drinks were refilled before we had to ask, and the courses arrived at a perfect pace. Even when the restaurant got busy, Carl remained calm, friendly, and completely professional.

It’s rare to find someone who clearly takes pride in their work like Carl does. He helped make the night feel more special, and we’ll definitely be coming back — largely because of the excellent experience he provided.

Highly recommend asking for Carl if you’re dining here. A true credit to the team. Found this place as a friend and I were looking for somewhere to meet for an overdue catchup

Fights, drugs, and people getting hurt happen way too often. They over-serve drinks like crazy — people leave totally wasted and it’s unsafe.

The staff are rude and don’t care, and the security do nothing when trouble starts. It’s honestly dangerous. This place needs to be closed down before someone seriously gets hurt.

Avoid it. Seems to be a decent bar on first entry however security do not care for the customers and have a major power trip. They were vile towards me and a friend of mine at the venue and the one female security staff member was cold and invalidated our concerns about men within the venue being perverted. If you can tolerate a lack of empathy from people who are there to protect you, it’s the perfect place for you!

I will never come back to this bar again. Got in at 2.30am on a Thursday morning. Paid 7£ for entry. There was free condom/lube at entry for pickup if wanted.

Thank you 👍😊.  I revisited today and they gave me another limited edition mug thank you Emma 🙏👍 Our favourite Starbucks location, we always enjoy visiting and our drinks are always well made even though wait times can be long on the weekends. Our only issue is that the sink in the disabled toilet has been leaking for months so the floor is always very wet and slippy! To be honest, a one star is generous, the service was absolutely awful, it took so long for our drinks to arrive and we had children with us, who were well behaved, although the one year old cried, which children do. we were kicked out because of this. a member of staff said we needed to leave or sit outside, we shouldn’t have to sit outside because the staff can’t concentrate, the noise was for no longer than 5 minutes. i am appalled at the treatment we received, they clearly do not have children or empathy. i would never step foot in that store ever again. Suggest you have a look round - the tables, chairs and the floor is absolutely filthy. It’s 11:30 on a Sunday morning so not even as if it’s the end of the day. Thank you to Emma for her outstanding customer service, for really giving my sister a boost that she really needed as she has been struggling this year.

Food arrived quickly and was hot and fresh. Would definitely order again. I was quite excited when seeing this on ubereats but was left disappointed.

The rice ruined the whole chicken soul box. It tasted stale, clumps of rice throughout the box all dry with no taste. The chicken was nice and crispy with a nice taste to it but there's only 3 tenders in the box. The coleslaw just tasted like cabbage and mayonnaise mixed together. Also got bay seasoned fries which I personally thought had too much seasoning on it and I wasn't keen on the flavour however that may just be my own personal taste.  For the price, it was not worth it at all. Treat yourself! This fried chicken and snacks are insanely good and perfect food for the flapper as well. We came here especially to try the food and we’ll definitely be back. We both had Cajun Chicken baskets and some jalapeño poppers and some Cajun gravy. Really reasonably priced and All delicious! The prefect food!!!!
The bar they are located in is perfect, it’s a calm family environment very friendly staff.
The food is absolutely amazing, the chicken poutine absolute classic crispy chicken cheesy Cajun chips and a drink worthy gravy. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!! I don't usually bother with reviews but this food was way too good not to review.....4 mains 3 sides and a desert between 4 of us and not a bite was left. And let me tell you those portions were big....I haven't eaten and enjoyed that much food in a long time...the crisp on that chicken is another level! 100% recommend you won't regret it !

Service is friendly and welcoming, if you get a seat by the large front windows in day time, there's a lovely view of the cathedral and it's grounds to take in.

Services were great and staff were very lovely. Went to the theatre here, on the 2nd floor. What a fabulous experience 😍 It was 'open mic night' and the theme seemed to be songs from musicals. Everyone who sang was amazing. This was no karaoke session. All singers were accompanied by the fantastic Callum, who seemed able to play effortlessly any tune required of him, and to such a high standard. It was just like being in an immersive musical for the entire evening. Oh, and did I mention it was FREE!

We did a last minute group booking for bowling and though would have loved to experience the arcade for longer , overall it was a good visit .
The Bowling experience was good and well priced , can't comment on drinks and food but recommended - Hollywood bowl never let's down . Came in just after it opened on a Sunday morning. The young lady on the welcome desk was very polite and friendly, we didn't interact with any other staff during our time there.

There was a decent looking arcade area, but the most interesting machines were switched off.

It's a fun day out, but there are better bowling alleys locally, which are also better priced. Went here for Bowling with work, had lots of fun.

We traveled all the way from London to Birmingham for an extraordinary buffet experience that truly exceeded expectations. With hundreds of dishes from every corner of the globe, this is a food lover’s paradise! Whether you’re craving Italian, Malaysian, Mexican, Chinese, or Indian cuisine, there’s something here for everyone.

What sets this buffet apart are the live cooking stations, where dishes are tailored to your preferences, ensuring every bite is just how you like it. The variety of grills, cooked right in front of you, adds a vibrant and interactive touch to the experience. Each dish bursts with flavor, perfectly balanced, fresh, and absolutely delicious.🤤

We couldn’t resist ending the meal on a sweet note with the chocolate fountain, marshmallows, and an array of desserts. It’s the perfect finale to an unforgettable feast!🥳

If you’re looking for your next foodie destination, this is it. This was our first day Birmingham so we decided to try out the local restaurants. This was a great experience. Nydile was very accommodating and explained in detail how the service operates. The selection was a bit more limited than I am I used to but I there was still a variety of foods to try. We dined on Friday and they had a 2 for 1 special on drinks. Very nice.

This fish here was amazing. Very tender and well seasoned. I would pair it with the chicken birani

My only negative was the children that were noisy and treating the atmosphere like their personal playground. Despite the employees’ efforts to kindly ask them to behave, the parents were simply allowing g them to do as they please. I think to support staff and other diners, there should be a policy around noise and general disruptive behaviours. Jimmy Spices in Birmingham offers a fantastic Indian dining experience with a great selection of dishes. I thoroughly enjoyed the Indian food and desserts—the flavors were rich, the spices were well-balanced, and everything was fresh and delicious.

A special shoutout to Nydile for their amazing hospitality! Their warm and attentive service made the experience even better. Highly recommend for anyone craving quality Indian food with great service! Amazing place to spend your eve
The quality and variety of food are outstanding. The presentation is beautiful, and the staff is so friendly and helpful.

My daughter attended Elms from the day after she turned 1 until she was the right age to move to the same school as her elder brother. As is normal, she cried when dropped and collected for the first few weeks but by week 6 she was leaping into the arms of her carers at Elms.

Emma in the Squirrel was my complete favourite because I always felt she loved my daughter as though she were her own and as such they had a fantastic bond. That kind of care made it so easy for me to go to work every day.

Whenever I dealt with the nursery managers regarding admin issues, they were responsive, reasonable and accomodating.

I definitely recommend Elms nursery. My daughter is thriving. Its hard to completely trust others with your child but I look forward to her nursery days as much as her.

I got some food from here on ""too good to go"" and my gosh it's actually the best jacket potato I've ever had I don't know if it's the potato they use or the butter or cheese or what but I wish mine turned out like that at home.

I bought a fruit smoothie as I saw it on the board outside, they also do veggie ones but I only saw that after I already ordered 😆.

Seems like a lovely place where the staff put love into their work.

I found this place from the app but I'm coming back here again myself to try out more of their menu.

Also attached to a rotating art gallery and has a cafe with tasty, well made coffee. Friendly staff! And generally a nice place to rest. Seems to wheelchair accessible which is awesome. Including a disabled toilet seemingly accessible for wheelchair uses! Lostalgia is a cool spot. Great coffee, a cozy vibe, and so many unique vintage finds. But honestly, Libby and Merissa are what make it special. They’re not just doing a job; they actually care, and you can feel it… Super warm, super genuine—just makes the whole experience better! Definitely worth checking out ;)

The shop was quite with only a handful of customers. What was astonishing was the number of tables that had not been cleared. It looks dirty and unwelcoming hence we left. There were two staff behind the counter chatting and laughing. Very disappointing will think again before giving them my custom.. Costa coffee are so mean they only have one member of staff on in the early morning.  This means customers have to wait for what seems an eternity to be served.  The lady behind the counter is under pressure and doing her best. Another member of staff for the first hour should be employed. At the extortionate prices costa charge this would equate to three cups of coffee. Costa put customer experience first and profits second. I have been to this costa a few times in the past and service/quality always seems to change. However, i thought i would write a review on my experience today.

The staff were fabulous today. They were a patient and a kind attitude. Unfortunately they didn’t have any assistance because the other members of staff were in the back. However, on their own (and still training) they made the most fabulous drinks.

If you are going to be sitting in, there is a large sitting area for all. However, keep up the work! Shop was clean. Staff were quite unfriendly - pulling a face when I walked in and 2 girls were purposely avoiding the till under another staff member served me. Coffee wasn’t the best - and didn’t taste at all like vanilla. Coffee tastes bitter and burnt. Wouldn’t come back. Was 9am on a Sunday morning. Stopped for a takeaway coffee with my dog to be told they don’t allow them.

There was only one staff and she was clearly overwhelmed between all orders coming in. The coffee dark sugar bubble tea I had was very milky, the strawberry matcha had nothing matcha but all sugar and the matcha bubble tea was not the tastier. For the price, there are way better options. Wouldn’t recommend. I tried the classic milk tea and I have to say that I was left quite disappointed, nth special first and last time trying it.The only upside would be the very affordable price. I got the Oreo frosted milk with brown sugar tapioca, large, for £6.25. It was nice but a bit expensive compared to similar I’ve had elsewhere in Birmingham. Had a lovely dairy-free Taro bubble tea during hot day. The decor was also quite pretty that I had to take pictures. The drinks were very watered down.

The server was very nice but there was only one person taking orders and making the drinks which made it slow, especially since it’s a busy area. This would have been fine if the drinks were nice but they were not.

I love bubble tea and seeing as it was my first time trying this place I went for the usually safe order of a brown sugar milk tea. However it was so watered down. I’ve had bubble teas before that just tasted like milk but this wasn’t even milk, it was watery milk.

And the whole point of a brown sugar is the syrup, which I chose after looking at the poster picture displaying the drink with  having lots of syrup all along the inside of the cup. In reality I couldn’t even see any syrup. I know pictures can exaggerate a bit but this was just false advertising. It was just brown watery milk with no syrup and the tapiocas were sticking together as well.

Also two of the drinks I asked for warm, as the sign specifically showed they offer both hot and cold, but what I received was just room temperature. I was disappointed.

Maybe their other products are fine but I would not recommend getting a milk tea from there, and if you do go expect there might be a wait.",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['milk', 'sugar', 'bubble', 'tea', 'bubble tea', 'syrup', 'brown sugar', 'brown', 'milk tea', 'matcha']","[""matcha"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""bubble"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""sugar"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Waiting Time"", ""milk"", ""Cafe"", ""brown"", ""milk tea"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""syrup"", ""Value"", ""brown sugar"", ""bubble tea"", ""Experience"", ""tea""]"

It was, once again  absolutely delicious.  It was great value for money, came very quickly and was piping hot. Brilliant find in Birmingham - unbelievable, fresh, delicious food in a lovely setting.

Only one security guy ruined the end of the night for us for shouting  at my boyfriends face “ because he is too tired” and he got a reaction.

Shouldn’t be shouting at clients that were enjoying the whole night without causing trouble , just because you had a long day at work.

I work as a bartender in a very busy nightclub and I have never shouted at one last costumer  ( especially knowing they been having  drinks) for wanting more drinks even when we’re closing down , I stay calm and still politely tell them it’s closed , I don’t start shouting “GO HOME” at them because I had a long shift.

Hopefully he works on that so clients don’t react that way anymore. Rest of the security were helpful and respectful to my boyfriend.

So overall was a very good night but the end bit. Lovely guy Levi (I think that's his name, mixed race guy with light eyes) made our girlz hen night a real treat last night!

Decent portion sizes, the fish and chips were piping hot when I got home (hence the short wait at the shop). Perhaps I came at the right time, or there has been a change in ownership recently? I’m not affiliated btw. Captain John's Fish & Chip Shop offers an average dining experience that leaves much to be desired.
The seating area, with its dirty tables and worn out bar stools which look like they’ve never been cleaned,
are poorly maintained and uninviting.

Service is functional but lacks warmth, making the overall experience feel quite unfriendly.
As for the food, it disappoints despite its appealing appearance. My friend had the fish and chips, as he avoids halal meat, but found the dish quite bland.
I opted for just the chips, which were basic and flavorless.

In summary, Captain John's is a passable option if you're only choice, but better alternatives are likely available for a more satisfying fish and chips meal. firstly i dont like writing negative reviews but my first experience here wasn't great, I thought id give it another go....

the second experience was the same, dry cold chips. When asked for fresh chips the lady said they had only come out few minutes ago, so I assumed they would be hot. When i got back home the chips tasted odd, stale or they had been put back in the fryer and then back out. Over priced and terrible food, fish wasn't great and the tikka which I had also wasn't great. Wish there was another chippy near by as I would never use these guys again, waste of money. Don't know what's happened but this place has gone down hill. Apparently this is a large meal but barley a handful of chips. I wondered why she went behind the prep area to wrap it. Also be careful of allergies as I ordered just donner kebab but the woman put the chicken on it whichever is based in something. When I pointed this out she just took the chicken off and put it BACK into the chicken pot with all the rest of the chicken.
Won't be going back (2023/08/09)
Got a chance of trying their Kebab, £4.80 for a Mixed Kebab Wrap. Just like their Cheese Burger, nothing was special about the taste. Though the quality was average, the portion was huge so worth the price. If you are picky about Kebab, better avoid to save your curiosity. Otherwise, go ahead and it should be okay. Their Curry Sauce and Gravy are very good, even better with the Chips.

(2023/07/26)
Tried some other items, so far the best ones for me are Fish and Pie. Their Cheese Burger is basically, a simple Cheese Burger. Bun, cheese, patty and that's it. Unless you really want a burger, do pick up some other items for your own sake. Trust me, the Pie and Chips deal is much better than the Cheese Burger and Chips deal. Ordered a Small Cod alone, still tasted good but as its name suggested it was really small considering the amount of crispy batter.

This restaurant was opened in May, a fairly new one. Although the staff showed some poker faces, the food was overall good during my first visit.

The chips were a little bit soggy. Apart from that, enjoyable Fish and Chips. Also ordered a Scallop, a Tinned Roe and a Large Battered Sausage. Did not like the sausage, the rest were fine. Please note none of Curry Sauce, Mushy Peas or Gravy was included in the Fish and Chips set. But a bunch of different sauces were provided for free including Ketchup, Mayo, Sweet Chilli, BBQ, Yogurt Mint and etc. And of course, Salt and Vinegar were available.

Because it is a Fish and Chips restaurant, do think twice before ordering some risky items.

If you get the chance go and pay a visit.  😊 Had a lovely day here. The house is beautifully presented and thoroughly interesting.

Parking in very small car park was difficult but free to use think there is parking close by it said on a sign near  cat park we were lucky but its really tight spaces !! Be warned
I was surprised how beautiful it was its not a big garden but has some interesting glass houses we took our son who’s not normally interested in visiting gardens with us but he enjoyed the glass houses and walk along the water/stream ! The cafe was pleasant  but he struggled with the choice of food as it was limited.A bit on the expensive side too .Sorry no pictures!

Everybody was so friendly and helpful from reception staff , dental nurses and the dentist herself was lovely. I didn’t feel  rushed and she was very thorough in her examination of my teeth and gums giving me options regarding what needs to be done .
She also took the time to have a little chat with me about my work and what my day had in store .
Whilst I was waiting in the waiting room a lovely older lady came in and when the dental nurse called her to go to see the dentist she was just so nice with her , greeted her with a lovely smile and to maintain eye contact with the lady the nurse walked backwards and confined her conversation and then as the lady was not great on her feet she offered to take her bag and she walked behind her up the stairs .
To sum up it was just so nice to see everybody  greeted with a smile , and just being friendly and nice and also very professional,
which can be rare these days . It was my first appointment. staff member at reception was very polite helped me with the questionnaire and another reception staff arranged further appointments.
The dentist she was very nice felt no pressure she explained everything to me options and choices given.
She made me feel at ease and relaxed.
Looking forward to my next few appointments.

I was a little uncertain given the odd review mentioning service problems with smaller groups. We were a table of 4 . My fears were quickly dispelled by a really good and well organised front of house team. We particularly liked Victoria’s attentive and charismatic charm throughout the evening.

This was our first visit to Bank and we’re delighted with the menu. Really good starters in fact they were exceptional. Fish was tasty and beautifully cooked. We all enjoyed the cocktails and the setting over the canal was lovely.

Personally I do think the meals are good value give the quality of the produce the presentation and location.

We will have to return if we are in the area again but will have to try the other restaurants within the chain when possible.

Thanks to the team for lovely evening. Well done Victoria and thanks for the truffles! I’ve come here many times before and always have great service - should’ve left reviews for those times so making sure I leave this for my recent visit on Saturday! The friend I was coming with is actually moving back to Australia so I wanted to sit out on the terrace (left a note on the booking) and the lady who greeted us was really helpful, she got us sat at the bar while we waited as it was full (not surprising as the sun was out) and then came to grab us within 10 minutes as she didn’t want us to miss the space - thank you!

Our server on the terrace was Renee, she was a whole vibe! Absolutely loved her, it was honestly like talking to a friend from start to finish. I know that is part of her job, but it wasn’t like being served normally - it was like being out with the girls, but she was still professional of course! We didn’t wait too long for anything, and when one of the drinks did take a little longer she came over and let us know which was nice. Her section was very busy but she still made us feel like a priority! I honestly love people like this - just friendly, funny, and know how to have a laugh! Thank you for making my friends only experience so lovely, and I’ll of course be back soon!

(THE FOOD IS ALWAYS GREAT BTW!) If you want to treat yourself (or your loved ones), Bank is a fantastic option. It's on the pricier side, but this is fine dining we're talking about!

We arrived a little early but were able to wait in the bar area until our table was ready. Our friendly server took us to our table and gave us plenty of time to browse the menu before ordering. Everything was incredibly clean and tidy. My partner and I both went for the veal, which was cooked perfectly. For dessert we tried the burnt Basque cheesecake, a favourite of ours and it didn't disappoint!

It was incredibly busy on the Sunday evening we visited, and the wait was around 30 minutes for our food. We thought this was acceptable given how busy they were.

As already mentioned, it's expensive here but well worth it for a special occasion. The bill includes an optional service charge, and speaking to our server we learned it does go to them and not the management and we were happy to pay it - the service really is very good.

You can park at the nearby Q-park or any of the other car parks in the area if you don't mind a short walk. As always the team are super friendly and always ready to lend a hand. I've always felt the price is so reasonable and makes this a great option. Please don't change in those two respects. You have everything spot on there.

(This is the second time I've reserved an area for one of my events but I have yet to try the food!)

A few things that to note for potential improvement.

1. The type of music from the DJ is the type of music you get in a gym when you workout. It would be such a better atmosphere to have Pop/Rnb/Hip-Hop/Ol' Skool - that would truly lend a hand to making the vibe so much more enjoyable as well as having a DJ who knows how to work and interact with a crowd. (This coming from a radio presenter and event host of over 25 years experience.)
2. The music is a bit too loud and makes speaking to people more difficult. When you have a function you want to be able to talk rather than shout at people.

That's my only two bits of feedback. Mothering Sunday family lunch for four today. Positives: lovely seating areas (indoor and outdoor), comfy chairs and benches. Nice views over the canal area. Staff friendly and numerous. Skipped the Mother's Day menu (£45 for 2 courses / £50 for three) and went a la carte. Great choice of dishes and drinks. Grill menu is excellent. Negatives: didn't get one of 3 Korean Chicken starters so 3 of us ate the starter and then 10min later the 4th came over. There should have been a goodwill gesture from the restaurant but there wasn't. We spent £60 a head on average so it's a bit of a miss by the establishment. A discretionary tip of 10% was paid but frankly I didn't think it was deserved.

All the guests said how fabulous the food was. Fresh, tasty, generous portions, with great choice of sauces and extras. They made it all happen, great service, plus a very reasonable way to feed 120 people a delicious meal! So glad we booked them. We highly recommend! I ordered a pulled pork burrito from Habaneros today, and the experience was incredibly disappointing. The cheese had an off taste, which completely ruined the meal. Several colleagues who also ordered agreed that something was not right. For a place that is always busy for lunch, this was unacceptable. Quality control needs serious improvement—I won’t be returning anytime soon. Extremely popular venue with a busy lunch rush most days. Decent value for money, not massive burrito but definetly decent sized. Felt like it’s a bit overrated though, the meat was not that flavourful and spicy sauces lacking a decent kick. Was decent but not worth the hype. Mostly takeaway only. Will note service is extremely quick which is good, but wonder if it is affecting quality. Our office come here a few times a week food is always great,
Our hump day  go to! korean pulled pork 🤌🏿
There is a queue but don't let that put you off-its fast and the food IS worth it!!
Unfortunately this week (Wed) it comes down to a staff/service issue when it gets to the final part of getting the food the sauce and packing bit, the chap is rude & impolite ,which we have come to expect but this week it was next level
(in comparison to the other staff who were great!)
Plus burrito was very poorly wrapped so
most of our office have switched to the rice box and homemade nachos which are definitely worth a try!
Other than that its efficient & delicious , highly recommended
UPDATE 25/06 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿our team was back in today for the special, fantastic !
Plus a Smooth friendly service. Great little spot in the city center, been a frequent visitor since the van .

We were a group of 7 and everything came out hot and delicious. We had a mix of breakfast sandwiches, breakfast wraps, small breakfast, Tea and Coffees and we were all very happy with everything!! Great little snack bar. Excellent veggie breakfast.
Just wish they could change the salt pots because the ones they have deliver salt at Tablespoons not sprinkles. Be warned! Probably one of best cafes in Birmingham.

We ordered, and the food was on the table in less than ten minutes. Staff were very friendly and the quality of the food was great. Absolutely amazing!!!

I was early so got to soak in the atmosphere of this charming pub and I wasn't disappointed.
I'd previously been here under the previous owners and wasn't that impressed, but then I noticed it had closed for a bit and has now reopened under new ownership.
I stopped for a pint when passing when it first reopened and knew I'd be back.
Ignore the old reviews as this place deserves to be judged on how it is now.
Good selection of drinks including 3 cask ales, food was really nice and reasonable prices and the staff were awesome.
I'll definitely be returning with more friends next time. Very quiet when visited on Sunday afternoon. Beer garden was fine. Beer selection was standard Heineken line up, nothing particularly interesting. Just a bit flat but nothing wrong either. Standard pub not far from the Eastside Rooms/Hotel. Basic pub food is reasonably priced. Always have a good selection of craft beer and have a decent rotation of beers. Staff are ok, haven't been the friendliest, but get the job done and are polite enough. Bar staff also tend the tables, so if it gets unexpectedly busy, be prepared to wait. They have TV screens and mainly show sports. Only ever been midweek, so not sure what its like on weekends Nice pub that serves food and shows Sky sports. Off the beaten track from Birmingham city centre, but not easy to get to. It caters for staff and students  at the adjacent Aston University. Quiet on my Sunday afternoon visit (out of term time), but the place was clean and tidy and the staff were friendly. My only complaint was that my can sparkling mineral water was a little expensive at £3! Typically, I appreciate the dining experience and ambiance. However, my recent encounter was markedly different. As a resident of Aston University’s campus, I and my companions frequently patronize the establishment for beverages. Today, I ordered my customary “Chicken Tikka Rice”, but to my dismay, the chicken was not cooked. Instead of expressing remorse for the error, the staff responded with rudeness. Such behavior is highly disrespectful and deeply disheartening to a loyal student.
The incident transpired approximately 20:45, when the kitchen was nearing its closing hour. In an attempt to expedite the process, the staff compelled me to place an order promptly.

The food is so delicious and nicely presented and the service is always friendly and efficient.  My favourite place in Birmingham for a delicious brunch. The menu changes which means there is always something new to try though sometimes I feel sad because the dish I fell in love with previously is no longer available 😄.

I have shared photos from two different visits so the menu was different. Felt the warm sense of welcome as soon as we walked in the entrance, being happily greeted by a member of staff.

Excellent service.

Homemade Chai Latte made my wife very happy. Generous helping of butter, not in a foil packet on the sourdough toast. WONDERFUL strawberry,  lime and mint jam. Wonderful place for a coffee some food and a catch up, not too loud. Gluten free options are amazing, all prepared I'm a separate part of the kitchen! The menu is mainly different types of sandwiches and they've got some delightful and rather bougie hashbrowns too. Everything on the menu can be gluten free. My only constructive criticism is that I wish they did an English breakfast, they've got the bacon, eggs, bread and hash browns on the menu, they could just add beans, ideally a sausage and they'd have it really Discovered this place while living in the Jewelery Quarter a few years ago and loved it. Came back today with my fiancé hoping to share a special breakfast. We were not disappointed.I had the avocado on toast with a side of delicious bacon which was good.

But overall it was nice, we did enjoy it. We visited on a Saturday afternoon at 5 pm for afternoon tea. The service was good. The staff were friendly and the afternoon tea was all lovely. It was nicely presented and really good value We went here today after having a brunch.  Place was lovely and busy.  Even though there were quite a few staff service was a little on the slower side.  Luckily we weren’t in any rush and when we did get to speak to staff, they were amazing.  Really went out their way for our requests. I ordered a milk cake and whilst it was a very nice cake I expected it to be as other milk cakes and drenched in milk so I was a little disappointed that it wasn’t.  Overall a nice experience and I would recommend :) Tucked away in a part of Birmingham I didn’t even know existed, this dessert shop was a great find. The menu had plenty of tempting options, and the seating area was not only spacious but also spotlessly clean. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the service was efficient and friendly.

We started with grilled tiger prawns and salt & pepper squid both were fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. The highlight of the starters, though, was the scallops, probably the best I’ve had in Birmingham served with a rich, creamy sauce that complemented them beautifully.

For mains, my wife chose the 3-cheese pizza, which was indulgent and packed with flavor, while I went for the rotisserie chicken in a spicy honey sauce. The chicken was juicy, tender, and had just the right balance of sweetness and heat.

On top of the fantastic food, the service was great, attentive, friendly, and efficient. We had a wonderful time and can’t wait to come back!

5/5 ⭐ Me and mum happened to cross The White Swan and popped in to see if we could get a Sunday dinner. The setting and atmosphere was just wonderful. The food was outstanding. We had driven from Leicester to Birmingham and would happily do the drive again to eat at The White Swan. The staff made you feel so welcome with great service. Highly recommend. Thanks for making our day. Amazing staff, Sandro was very attentive,  nothing was too much trouble.
Chefs are extremely talented, food flavours complemented each other, the crispy Duck salad kept giving, the warm ginger and carrot slaw, the crunchy noodles and the fresh taste of pineapple ketchup!
Ooo well worth the visit, and to top it off with Toffee Crèmè Brûlée, what a surprise, a smooth rich toffee sauce to greet you when you get to the bottom definitely Delicious! 😋 We recently visited The White Swan for a Valentines meal. This is the second time we’ve eaten here and we couldn’t recommend the place enough, the Atmosphere is so relaxed yet elegant, the staff are really friendly and attentive and the food was superb.
Special Mention to Debs who has been exceptional on all out visits, friendly, professional and along with the other staff members really made us feel welcome and added to our experience,  Thank you to all the team. We have already booked back in for Mother’s Day and will no doubt be back for a few visits before then.

Ian & Emma I came in during lunch and, short on time for their lunch set, opted for the steak fillet sandwich—and it was lovely. I appreciated being given the option to choose my steak’s temperature, a detail that speaks well of the restaurant’s commitment to quality. I went for medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection. Although a fillet can sometimes be a bit tough, this one was mostly tender and exceptionally juicy. The dish came with a side of skinny fries that were perfectly crispy on the outside and delightfully fluffy on the inside. Complementing the sandwich was a beef dripping sauce—essentially a rich jus—that was simply amazing. Overall, a very good experience.

There is a no smoking policy inside the establishment. It's a great place for groups. Music- rotating DJ that plays a wide variety of music.

However the rest rooms are upstairs so prepare yourself to climb a few stairs. This place is not for children or pets.

The staff serve with a smile and are extremely polite, we had a great experience here. The sweet treats and drinks were really nice with the right balance of flavour.

Worth a visit! Absolutely loved our visit to Cake and Culture in Birmingham! The pastries were outstanding; crispy, fresh, and full of flavour. The pistachio and almond croissants were beautifully done, and that chocolate hazelnut dessert was a showstopper, rich and perfectly balanced. The presentation was elegant and the vibe of the place warm and welcoming..

The service was warm and attentive, and the entire space feels thoughtfully designed – from the plush seating to the natural light pouring through the windows. The food and drinks were equally delightful, offering a fresh and flavourful selection that matched the ambience perfectly.

Highly recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth or looking for a perfect coffee break I had a lovely visit to Cake & Culture with our group of friends on their opening day. Super busy coffee shop, the coffee was really beautiful, I really love when I get a good cup of coffee! Their croissants are so beautiful and fluffy, and the little pyramid cake was so yummy! I also tried the goat cheese and fig pastry which I highly recommend, it was such a nice mix of sweet and savoury. Before I left, I treated myself to a box of chocolates because I tried the Salted Vanilla and the Strawberry cheesecake and was blown away by the quality. Everything felt thoughtful and well-made. I’ll definitely be coming back to try out many more beautiful things that they have. Great addition to Edgbaston. A Hidden Gem for Coffee and Dessert Lovers – Cake and Culture

Spent a lovely afternoon with the wife at this cafe. It was calm and minimalistic, with a clean aesthetic and a really relaxing vibe. I enjoyed a smooth and well-balanced espresso with a beautifully presented black forest slice and there was certainly no complaints from the better half who opted for a strawberry tartlet and latte. Staff were warm, attentive, and made us feel welcome without being overbearing.

Would love to see a V60 pour over on the menu in the future — it would be a perfect fit for the space and give filter coffee fans a reason to linger. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys thoughtful coffee and a peaceful atmosphere. Cake & Culture is a delightful French-inspired patisserie in Edgbaston, Birmingham. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted with an inviting atmosphere and an array of beautifully crafted pastries and cakes that are as pleasing to the eye as they are to the palate. They have a great selection of coffee drinks. Their selection of macarons, chocolates, and savoury items showcases a commitment to quality and authenticity. The staff are friendly and attentive, ensuring a pleasant experience whether you’re stopping by for a quick treat or a leisurely coffee.

The hotel is in a quiet location away from the main roads and nightlife. Rooms are a good size, with very good mattresses and pillows. The air conditioning is not the quietest and doesn't go quite as cool as I would like. Bathrooms generally comprise a shower with no bath, which is how I prefer it. Service was excellent throughout, and breakfast is very good value for money. There is a limited bar however no food service at lunch and dinner. One of the lifts was out of order throughout, which caused minor delays at peak times. Overall, good value for money and I would stay again. Great location and the rooms are clean and well laid out. The breakfast is good and bar well stocked. However in the rooms the windows are sealed and the air conditioning unit was very loud and not very good. We also paid for late check out, however were woken to a staff member knocking on our door at regular check out time, telling us to check out (this was resolved quickly but we had been woken up, hoping for a little more sleep). Good value and polite staff but a few things could be better. Stayed in Sunday night as we were seeing ELO at the Utilitia Arena. We found the hotel and car park quite easily. Parking is £15 for 24 hours which was good. Check in was very smooth and the young girl who checked us in was very polite and informative. Our room was very clean and it had all the amenities that you would need. Had a good night's sleep in the comfy bed. I set my alarm for 8.15 for breakfast. When it went off I had a moment, and thought I was late for work, ha ha. Went down for breakfast, we hadn't pre booked it but that was fine. £18 for a buffet breakfast for 2. My only criticism is that it could be a bit better spaced out. The ladies in the kitchen were replenishing things all the time. I did miss my fried egg though, as I only eat the yolk. Late check out was good. Had a walk round the  Bullring then came back for the car. All in all a fab stay, would highly recommend.

Chicken sizzler and beef steak stir fry was flavorless, some pieces were barely cooked while others were practically mush. The chicken and beef slices were grisly, swimming in a greasy pool burnt gravy. There was no balance in the flavour as if someone had thrown random ingredients together without any thought how they might actually taste. However, surprisingly this place has got 4.9 I wonder who give such positive reviews to a restaurant that is actually not worth at all. Wasted my money.

Great event with a wide variety of food and drink stands. However limited choice if you have an allergy especially a gluten allergy. You do have to pay for your ticket and then the food when you are there including drinks, which does make it an expensive evening out. Fantastic street food setup! A great way to discover new cuisines and try different street food establishments. I love that it promotes a variety of cuisines and always gets such a great turnout. Definitely the best place to go for street food in the Midlands. I attended the one held at Coventry cathedral ruins, which had a great array of vendors, a DJ and a lovely cathedral back drop. Had some amazing street food from Cleopatra's Kitchen Solihull (best middle Eastern food I've eaten) and beef on the block (beautifully cooked tender melt in the mouth steak). Good selection of independent street food vendors.
The venue itself is m a little slow to open up exactly on time.
There is one food vendor (one of the pizza ones, I forgot which one) who I thought was quite rude as I had asked for a bottle of water that was on his drinks menu, he stated that you have to get drinks from the bar. Okay but why have the drinks menu up?
Prices of food is mainly £5+, many vendors don’t accept card so take cash. Really poor selection of food. All seemed to be UPF with huge focus on meat. Went to the event at Attingham Park and after looking at what was on offer we left and went and had lunch elsewhere. Very disappointing. I'd recommend checking what stalls are going to  be at any event before committing to going. Would not recommend.

Been Eating From Here For Years, Very Generous Portion Sizes & Tastes Amazing. Each Bite Is Like A Trip To Taste Bud Heaven 🤤

Highly Recommend - If You Haven’t Tried This Place Yet ….. What Are You Waiting For ? 👀 First visited this restaurant last summer with a friend and was amazed by the saffron rice so told my husband I would go with him cause he had to try this amazing rice
We were looking for somewhere to break our fast (iftar) and we decided to go here
We were 20 mins late to our booking due to the traffic in the city centre so I called and the person that answered just put the phone down, if it wasn’t Iftar time we would’ve gone elsewhere but due to how busy it would be everywhere else we decided to still go there
I called back and said we were 7 mins away and the time to break fast was 2 mins ago can I place my order via the phone so we can have it as soon as we get there but the person that took my call said no and put the phone down.. rude

We got there ordered our food and waited around half an hour.. do not get the mixed platter for 2 it’s a scam and so over priced for what you get.. but this is what the waiter pushed us to get
You’re better off getting two individual meals and the portions are a lot better and better value for money, the saffron rice was disappointing and was the only reason I wanted to go back.. was really bland
We noticed we were treated a lot different to the other customers as we were the only brown/muslim couple there and other tables were offered complimentary olives and sides etc.. where was ours? We got given little chunks of dried cookies to break our fast
I won’t be visiting again unfortunately Fresh, tasty, delicious,
Tender kebabs!

Price and portion size match perfectly. Staff are extremely polite and the place has a cosy vibe. I often order for delivery but eat in is also a great experience.

I anticipated we may be slightly late so emailed to ask if we could move the brunch forward 30 minutes however no one responded.

We managed to arrive at our original time and drink and food orders were taken promptly. The food was nice and the variety of drinks kept everyone happy. Service was prompt.

Our brunch was due to finish at 3.30pm so the waitress came over at 3pm and said the brunch is finishing soon so can I get you some more drinks then I'll take your final order after that. Throughout the brunch we had been finishing our drinks in around 5-7 minutes. The waitress arrived at 3.15pm with our last drinks then promptly took payment for the brunch. We still had 15 minutes left of our 90 minutes, which we believed we could have easily had one more order. I have been to most of the bottomless brunches in Birmingham and also other places in the UK and usually the last order is taken at the end of the brunch.

When we questioned this, we were advised that our time started from when we started drinking, so my friend stated that we placed our drinks order at 2pm and didn't start drinking til after 2pm if that was the policy and the waitress said ""well I took your order at 2pm."" The argument we had was that we still had 15 minutes left of our brunch and they were taking our payment trying to get us off the table before the 90 minutes was up.

I feel we had a completely valid point and something that I have never come across at any other bottomless and that we asked politely, yet we were met with attitude from the waitress. Everything up until this point was great.

My recommendation would be that if you want to go to a bottomless brunch where you are actually given the whole 90 minutes as promised on the t&c's then to attend elsewhere! Lovely building and you can make your own gin has to be a good thing 😀 we had dinner before watching ELO over and out tour in his home town.
Great drinks and cocktails 🍸 dinner was delicious the menu had not been updated from the wab site so no Sunday dinners only ice for dessert!! should be better Went for the puppy experience. It was so good.
The dogs really enjoy themselves and are monitored really closely by the owner and staff.
After you get a large pizza it is basic but very nice and presented well. Great bar for a sunny afternoon, plenty of outdoor seats and a great drinks selection.

Poor customer service for a bank that claims to be reliable. Your bank is truly incompetent and useless — it’s been over a month now that I’ve had an issue with Apple Pay, and no one has been able to resolve it, neither over the phone nor in person.

Today, I even went to one of your branches in person, and one of your employees put me in a room for an hour and a half, called your customer service from there, took no responsibility whatsoever, and then just left me alone to deal with it while they went about their own tasks. I could’ve made that call from home myself!!!!!!what a complete waste of time!!!!!!!
In the end, my issue is still unresolved, and now my phone is practically useless. This situation is unacceptable.!!!

Avoid KFC like the plague unless you want to ruin your taste buds and your sense of smell. Pathetic. Had an amazing experience at KFC! The burger, roll, and chicken wings were served hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. Every bite was full of flavor.

I was first let in by the very nice bouncers however once at the bar I was then again asked for my id. After looking at it for one second I was told I could not be served as ‘it was not a British id’. They then told me that it was their policy to not let in anyone not British as although my parents ARE English I am from Belgium. This had never been an issue since moving to the uk. The server then walked off and ignored us. Not only do I think I was not served because I was not born in this country but also due to the fact that I am visibly queer. Would never recommend giving any money to such a backwards and old fashioned establishment. I went here with my young toddler children. I am a British born asian man. People kept staring at us all the time. This made me and my children feel extremely uncomfortable. We were only there for about 15 minutes and we left because of the constant stares. They made us feel really unwelcome. Everybody in the pub was white. Avoid this pub if you are not white as you will get bad looks from staff and other people in the pub. It was a very unpleasant experience. Didn't realise it was a whites only pub by the looks of it. This is disgusting considering we are now modern times. The pub needs to clean up its act and cater for all regardless of race or nationality. We are humans at the end of day. God made different races. The world does consist of just white people! So me and my family come in and some one decided to kick us out she has short shaved hair and was very rude taking photos of us I tried to get image as I don’t know her name she was a rude member   of staff and I don’t appreciate it what so ever … my sister knocked over a board and said she was too drunk even tho she was not and I’m sorry but if I can write this now it will go to show you that I am not drunk (my sister went to reach out to pay bill and knocked over the board this is the most pathetic thing in the world and I would love some one to call me back regarding this case many thanks ell) If you are afte a traditional pub in the heart of Harborne then this is the place. There are no 'heirs or graces' here and you may well appreciate it.
This is an old school honest public house.
It has the modern amenities but you will simply come here for a pint and feel the community spirit.
The value for money here is crazy so if you are on a budget you need look no further.

The last time we went was before lockdown, and the cafe has definitely had a glow up. We ordered the Full Veggie Breakfast: which consists of two vegan recipe sausages, quarter avocado, fried egg, flat mushroom, grilled tomato half, hash brown, Heinz Baked Beans and toast. They gave the option to swap out any of the items for something else, and we chose to swap out the egg and sausages for extra hash browns, as the hash browns from the Morrisons Cafe are unbeatable! The hash browns were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, the perfect hash browns!

The interior of the cafe was spacious and there was plenty of seating area. There were tables for two as well as tables for larger groups, which we thought was very convenient. We were sat at a table near the window, so we had a view whilst we were having brunch.
We really enjoyed the breakfast and we will definitely be back soon! I’m not a fan of this new style service , where there’s no staff anywhere. The machine gave no receipt and seems likely didn’t accept my more card as I do not appear to have had my bonus points. The cafe is bright and clean and wasn’t too busy it took 10 minutes to get our food, which is fine. The food was fine but as I wasn’t able to specify well done bacon wasn’t really to my liking. Whilst I understand the reason for taking away the sauces, it does feel a bit tight. The cappuccino was nice enough and free refills are a bonus if you like a lot of coffee!! The toilets were a state which I find unusual for a Morrisons. I only had a small breakfast which is what I would normally have but it really didn’t feel enough, but it’s reasonable value at £5.50. I’m unlikely to return due to not being able to specify exactly how I want my food. Staff are great, always friendly and happy to help. Food doesn’t take too long and is always hot and fresh, plus free refills on hot drinks. The food served here is good—I have no issues with the quality at all. However, the coffee wasn’t as hot as I’d like it to be. They do offer free refills, but since the first cup wasn’t great, I didn’t take them up on it. The service could use some improvement; it’s not particularly attentive or efficient. Additionally, the cleanliness of the place leaves something to be desired—it often feels a bit untidy.

On the plus side, the prices are very affordable, so for the cost, it’s hard to complain too much. It’s a budget-friendly option, but there are definitely areas that could be better, like the coffee temperature, service, and overall cleanliness. My wife and I ordered two English breakfasts, and it took over 30 minutes to get our order. When we finally received it, the food was cold and seemed like it had been prepared and left out for hours.

It was fun to dance on tables and chairs, but it would’ve been nice to have a bit more floor space to dance as everyone was having to stay seated or at the table they chose for most of the time as it was so packed.

The toilets were not up to my standards and they’re very small, so people were queueing to go.

I didn’t get to try the food, but it smelled amazing😌 Popped in for a game of darts and pool while watching the football. Fairly reasonably priced with a nice selection of beers. Plenty of pool tables so even though it was busy you could still get a table. The Dart boards have seen better days and could do with being renewed. I didn’t have any food but what I saw being served looked ok. The staff were really friendly. I recently visited and I cannot fault anything. The pool, the drinks, the atmosphere but most importantly the service. Owen and Ellie were exceptional and thank them for providing 10/10 customer satisfaction Never had the food, but I visit here often enough, the 2 American pool tables closest to the bar/darts area are a utter nightmare to play on, as there are a few of the pockets which fall out, so you have to then run the balls down that are rolling all over the place and they have various areas of water damage on the linings, which makes resting ones hands in one of them spots an awful feeling so please sort things out. As I feel it ruins the experience as the music there is often a vibe for the younger ear, so it's not a bad place just needs a few improvements.

Oh, the roof keepings leaking as well and some of the sticks are missing the pads from the top or there weighs but other than that, it's okay could be much better,  would I recommend No- will I still frequent possibly. So refub needed I feel, as the seating and painting on the walls were nice additions but the roof, tables and sticks there need to be upgraded with brand new ones asap. The staff are all pleasant and well mannered, so it's only being let down by the quality of the items there.

Lastly, the placement of the tables are  too close together so there are times where I've been bumped into mid aim of my turn which has resulted in me missing my shot or giving 2 goes away, cause the neighbouring table are way less than a pool stick away,  so maybe remove the top 2 tables and organise the space better. The venue feels abandoned and dirty, even on a weekend evening. The staff was so unenthusiastic that it put me off from the start.

We came to play darts and it wasn't a great experience. The board was placed in the worst location with people (including staff) constantly walking past and stopping us from playing. Also, there was no sponge to wipe the board after the game and we asked a staff member for one, but instead she came over to do it and took like 5 minutes rubbing it for no reason!

Overall the place felt very unwelcoming and I'd much rather choose a different bar.",0.8,0.2,"[""Cafe"", ""Bar/Pub""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['pool', 'darts', 'tables', 'pool tables', 'sticks', 'bingo', 'dance', 'roof', 'missing', 'game']","[""darts"", ""Bar/Pub"", ""tables"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""missing"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""roof"", ""Waiting Time"", ""Portion Size"", ""Location"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Cafe"", ""sticks"", ""bingo"", ""Booking/Entry"", ""dance"", ""Sound/Noise"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""pool"", ""Drinks"", ""pool tables"", ""game"", ""Value"", ""Experience""]"

While sitting there, the aroma coming from the kitchen made you feel like you were on holiday next to someone BBQing.

The first dish was good. I was expecting it to be salty. It was creamy, with four flavours all taking their turns to excite your taste buds.

The second dish was so fresh and seasonal.

The cod was different. I like it more as a winter dish.

The BBQ mussels dish had lots going on. If you could just hook it straight to my veins.

The showstopper, the duck. This was mind-blowing. I could have this as a Sunday dinner. Almost as a chef teasing you with a trailer, then bam, you get the start of the show. I hope this becomes a regular dish.

Last, we have the banana dish. This left you refreshed. The wilderness is fantastic! The food was tasty, seasoned well and wonderfully presented.

I don’t pass through Birmingham often, but will always visit this coffee shop over others because of how great the staff are.

I had a similarly great experience a few years ago after a really awful train journey, at night or in the morning the staff are always wonderful and welcoming.

They where able to answer my random questions about your ( Prets ) coffees to making my drinks order just the way I requested.

Onto the 3rd and final lounge on my Birmingham tour, ended up at Le Mirage. Upon entering we were asked to take a seat anywhere we liked so we decided to seat in these booth style sofa right at the end, seating was comfortable. Decided to order something we haven’t tried before so green ice pops it was. Shisha came out within 10 minutes in a old school ice chamber pipe, might be a KM but unsure we were also given disposable pipes. Shisha was good but the flavour died down within 30-40 minutes and this was because of the Egyptian head they use I tend to find these types of bowls give off a more harsher smoke. Lounge was big in size with plenty of seating. Price since you are in Birmingham is pretty decent and cards are accepted. Parking is a bit difficult as the roads have parking restrictions but if there’s a space on the pavement you just dump your car there. Vibe was good it was getting busier just as we were leaving. Overall a decent lounge to visit with hot food and desserts also served. Really nice place, visiting from London so not local to the area. The shisha was lovely and at such a good price, food was okay and had a ferrero rocher milkshake, was nice. Service was okay and we got given personal heaters as it was cold. Cute little booths and quite a big lounge, only thing is parking, only double yellow nearby. Would recommend though, I will defo be coming back here again.",0.6,0.4,"[""Dessert""]","[""Service"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Value"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Location"", ""Drinks"", ""Experience"", ""Portion Size"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Recommendation Tendency""]","['shisha', 'lounge', 'lounge birmingham', 'ice', 'parking', 'green', 'seat', 'seating', '10', 'price']","[""seat"", ""lounge birmingham"", ""Recommendation Tendency"", ""Service"", ""seating"", ""lounge"", ""Dessert"", ""green"", ""Food Quality"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Ventilation/AC"", ""Seating/Comfort"", ""Portion Size"", ""shisha"", ""Location"", ""price"", ""Cleanliness"", ""Emotional Tone"", ""Drinks"", ""parking"", ""ice"", ""10"", ""Value"", ""Experience""]"
